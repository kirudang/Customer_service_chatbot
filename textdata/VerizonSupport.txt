@VerizonSupport I finally got someone that helped me, thanks!
@VerizonSupport What else can I provide? They refuse to help me because they cannot validate the account...
@VerizonSupport How? I have my phone number and email, that's it. How did I get equipment and service? I'm literally trying to pay and nobody can find me?
@VerizonSupport Don’t know, router is downstairs. But it’s just the WiFi Nothing connected to Ethernet
@VerizonSupport Just randomly boots me offline there it goes again
@VerizonSupport Yep
@VerizonSupport Cuts out every 20 minutes this is ridiculous
@VerizonSupport Banking. https://t.co/8535p04F9S
@VerizonSupport Problem has been consistently happening for about a month
@VerizonSupport I’m standing in front of it
@VerizonSupport Ok. Now what?
@VerizonSupport Didn’t work. Channels come up in guide (always have) by tv freezes when changing to anything under 523.
@VerizonSupport Yes it is.
@VerizonSupport Same problem on both boxes
@VerizonSupport I’m on the phone with your tech now looks like I’ll be another day without internet
@VerizonSupport Cool, thanks

@VerizonSupport yea I have, it appears to be routing to Washington and then to France
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/QXYZ47KIps
@VerizonSupport I have not
@VerizonSupport Same reports on @116655 from other FiOS users around the north east.  Is this something Verizon is investigating or could join in on?  Been over 4 hours of outage for some. https://t.co/2Ecdop6zl1
@VerizonSupport I did
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Nope. A few states away actually. The airbnb we're in doesn't have espnews so we signed in with our Verizon account to go to espn3 and watch. Doesn't allow us. Which I don't get since I know we have espnews back home
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/BcPl6i84L0
@VerizonSupport I just tried from a wired connection. Download speed at 153 mpbs, upload speed hovered at 0.5 mbps before ultimately asking me to try again later. I tried again and download speed hovered at 5 mbps and eventually failed.
@VerizonSupport Hi Jay, I was using the my Fios app
@VerizonSupport No, it's not selectable on guide or directly entering #. It goes to 455 instead
@VerizonSupport All tvs, its a local channel so it's part of my basic service
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Done.. No changes
@VerizonSupport Yes. Guide for 466, the programs are airing on 506. 506 guide doesn't correspond to anything https://t.co/pDEGjNS9ox
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport No message, can't tune to it at all
@VerizonSupport Correct
@VerizonSupport Channel 506 is WBIN-TV, it was 466 which data is right
@VerizonSupport ty
@VerizonSupport After 2 hours of customer service we finally fixed it thankfully our contract is up and we will not be renewed with you guys
@VerizonSupport The order was not completed because there was an issue regarding my address not showing up in the system which multiple people could not fix https://t.co/75F8uCOmbU
@VerizonSupport It’s not an online order. I tried to make a triple play order via telephone services, got disconnected, and the order can not be found now
@VerizonSupport The order was not completed because there was an issue regarding my address not showing up in the system which multiple people could not fix https://t.co/qmJSKw54vS
@VerizonSupport They just know we all have so many problems.
@VerizonSupport Wireless. Customer service had to cancel my online order. I'm at the store now trying again.
@VerizonSupport What is it you want me to do?
@VerizonSupport It’s on the outside wall. Every connection is tight. https://t.co/ZBGuWBgLcI
@VerizonSupport No I have not.
@VerizonSupport We have - but you’re not available here... wish you were
@VerizonSupport What does that mean? We have a DVR cable box that stopped working after having it for 2 months. They sent a replacement.
@VerizonSupport Yes, the box needed to be replaced.
@VerizonSupport Just the tv
@VerizonSupport None of channels are unavailable. We’ve tried to troubleshoot it but it isn’t working. It isn’t a video/picture issue
@VerizonSupport Yes they’re all having the same issue
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport It’s secured. What’s next?
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I did that. Nothing happened
@VerizonSupport Yes that didn’t work
@VerizonSupport Do you know how long the wait time is?
@VerizonSupport Thank you!
@VerizonSupport I was given a device that some idiot sent to redirect my calls which also didn’t work
@VerizonSupport It’s a nice simple small claims case
@VerizonSupport If I want to upgrade my tv package and my tv says it'll cost $30 more per month, will I get charged for Oct. if I upgrade today? Or prorate
@VerizonSupport Ok so I won't be charged $30 for the entire month of October and then another $30 for November? It'll be prorated for October, right?
@VerizonSupport Thanks for quick response. All LEDs on router were green but no internet. Router DHCP was fine just no outside. Router reset resolved!
@VerizonSupport yes its happening to both
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/5THN1Dv2Do
@VerizonSupport 83.85 download 94.99 upload on wired. 61.81 download 54.82 upload wireless
@VerizonSupport i get 100/100 mbps but what i dont understand is why everything keeps buffering like i get less than a Mb
@VerizonSupport youtube, twitch are the main sites i have trouble with. wpuld you like me to post results of the tracerts from these two websites?
@VerizonSupport Definite wireless. My Xbox is wired, and video constantly slows and has to cache. So I think that too
@VerizonSupport It’s a little higher now https://t.co/Lg4MzEaYY2
@VerizonSupport It appears everything is fine now.... this happens a lot, randomly
@VerizonSupport @118797 JK, we back. Things seem okay. Will continue to monitor. WEEEEEE.
@VerizonSupport Yes, it's with all websites and it's in games too. Tried restarting router but didnt work. How do I show you tracerts?
@VerizonSupport Here you go https://t.co/8u2GWVuEyF
@VerizonSupport No, just a test.
@VerizonSupport Sure. https://t.co/M0PgolOjSs
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport It’s also when I’m playing video games.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I don't think I'm even using that.
@VerizonSupport HDTV +xBox +Fios connection. Ive experienced this issue for yrs. It always looks like the throttling issue to me. Eg https://t.co/BkhlnNfSfu
@VerizonSupport I really appreciate you reaching out RMD. Looking for fast internet that isn’t throttled. Cc: @115900
@VerizonSupport Thanks #Verizon; it isn’t #FiOS, it’s the #FXNow app. There is no sound on the live TV after trying 30 minutes.😢 @4857 @928
@VerizonSupport Home. Fios tv
@VerizonSupport The guide and info has not been working on my DVR box for a few days.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Thank you
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/KfY0DN54G1
@VerizonSupport Oh by the way...1 hour and 17 minutes now on hold
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Says service is unavailable at this time please try again later.
@VerizonSupport I told you moron I'm not using the app, pay attention your just as bad as your service
@VerizonSupport Did all that genius, now it's telling me I need to create a new temporary password,  still waiting for you to send it to me. It's been awhil
@VerizonSupport Yeah but I never got my temporary password so it's still useless. Guess I just won't pay it.
@VerizonSupport Text, but I don't care anymore sick of your company harassing me, I'll just not pay
@VerizonSupport Yes it is, stop making excuses for yoir shitty company.  I'm done with it. Just won't pay it.  You don't want my money then fine don't text
@VerizonSupport No I'm on your website, don't call me to ask me to pay my bill if you won't let me long on to pay it.
@VerizonSupport Well that explains it, thanks for the info.
@VerizonSupport My office phone and internet have been out for two weeks. Maybe it’s for me?
@VerizonSupport Apparently @VerizonSupport is experiencing "longer than average wait times." Tell me about it. My office phone and internet has been out for more than two weeks. Same with my neighbors. Someone @115725 is lying to their boss, not just to me.
@VerizonSupport FiOS. And I love it. Not a single problem in 9 years.
@VerizonSupport Awesome. My @115725 office phones and internet have been out for more than two weeks, with nothing but broken promises and bullshit excuses. I’m going to drop my home FiOS because I won’t be able to pay for it anymore.
@VerizonSupport I have December 11 scheduled but it’d be perfect if it could be the 10th...
@VerizonSupport I have restarted the router multiple times and also reset the ONT. All produced the same result - no broadband connection.
@VerizonSupport It is red, yes. And I'm seeing there are other reports coming in regarding loss of connection in the area.
@VerizonSupport TWC in New York had it. I don't know where you get the feeds, but Verizon is big enough to make this better if it wanted to.

Then again, despite several appointments my service is spotty enough I'm watching on a livestream. Should probably switch to Comcast
@VerizonSupport You're DNS servers werent responding. We are good now.
@VerizonSupport And now it's back. More DNS issues.
@VerizonSupport And it's down again. What the actual fuck right now.
@VerizonSupport I DM’d y’all  10 minutes ago .I’m still on hold....
@VerizonSupport I'ld love that, but not at the 3 MB maximum DL you all currently have in the area =p.
@VerizonSupport Tx for your time
@VerizonSupport And to make old customers to switch too
@VerizonSupport Yes it has actually been like this for a couple weeks. Then it says check cables. But all other channels are working.
@VerizonSupport Did you get the reply?  System status and power ok lights are green.  I am hoping to get a tech to check the bbu and ont very soon.
@VerizonSupport Told to call in am. So office could be xontacted for earlier appt.  Was on hold for over 20 mins and disconnected when giving tick #
@VerizonSupport Yes.  Next tues.  That would be 8 days wo service.  Trying to get something sooner.
@VerizonSupport We can't just contact the office directly and ask if they can do any better than the online computer system?
@VerizonSupport You service my area but not my building, how do I make a request?
@VerizonSupport Just did!
@VerizonSupport Repeatedly sends me to auto system that texts a code to my dead mom's phone which we donated as we thought it was take care of. JFC
@VerizonSupport This is not a direct number. I'm still getting shuffled to automated system. UNBELIEVABLE! Please help. This is ridiculous #verizonfraud
@VerizonSupport When we removed our old router no light for internet went on and then when we plugged in the new one we got the orange light
@VerizonSupport Yeah. It’s off
@VerizonSupport Ok where is the alarm reset button? https://t.co/bSc2OVAFOa
@VerizonSupport It beeps. Is that normal?
@VerizonSupport Ok great! Still no internet
@VerizonSupport @115990 I need your marketing team to work with your dev team to give me an option to disable push notifications
@VerizonSupport Ive rebooted on multiple occasions. It’s never been this bad, just a month ago it started acting up though I expected it to return
@VerizonSupport I don’t have access to my router right now, but usually the earth looking icon is lit white
@VerizonSupport Residential. I got it to work on Firefox, but have uninstalled and reinstalled my app and it's still not working. Hasn't worked in a while.
@VerizonSupport I'm using an iPhone 7 Plus and that's where I'm seeing the issue.
@VerizonSupport You can pm me for more details if you would like. I did get someone this morning who escalated to "level 3" and appears to know more...
@VerizonSupport I do. I just need a return label.
@VerizonSupport Not working for some reason. On the phone with a customer service rep. Thanks for trying anyway.
@VerizonSupport The day after it was on. Not buying it.
@VerizonSupport Today is 11/1/2017 ^CAR
@VerizonSupport And my 24th birthday is on 11/30/2017 ^CAR 😀 🎂
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/KMgkeRWB96
@VerizonSupport They said I was speaking with someone from the Multi Millions company or something like that? I said that I wasn’t interested and hung up.
@VerizonSupport Thank you.
@VerizonSupport I have already contacted telephone support. They have someone scheduled for later this afternoon.
@VerizonSupport Thanks to Ken, the technician who showed, I have all of my service restored.
@VerizonSupport Like what ^CAR
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Power=steady green, wan, lan, internet, wireless are all blinking green at the moment and I'm connected, will try to look at it next time
@VerizonSupport Residential  unstable signal constantly
@VerizonSupport Both
@VerizonSupport Actiontec slow speed unacceptable in 2017
@VerizonSupport I don't have FIOS
@VerizonSupport Won't load...unstable connection
@VerizonSupport 41mbps
@VerizonSupport No wireless
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport I called already, a rep will be here tomorrow :) I just wish a two second power outage didn't take down the whole house ya know
@VerizonSupport Yes it is, also hitting a family member on Verizon as well (3 calls this morning).
@VerizonSupport Is there any way to get someone deployed to check the equipment? This seems to be a recurring theme and no one has been out to check the equipment in over 4 years.
@VerizonSupport I will gladly when it occurs. This is always the issue; it is not consistent. I've asked that my equipment and fiber run be checked to no avail.
@VerizonSupport Yes, and at the time it occurs, it appears to be hanging at Verizon servers. Usually however, when it occurs, it just hangs for a while and then suddenly starts working, almost as though the connection is being reset.
@VerizonSupport Speed tests always come back looking great. It is intermittent and it's usually targeted: YouTube, Netflix, etc. Sometimes connection will be great, other times it will plummet and I can't even access normal websites.
@VerizonSupport It’s a local channel
@VerizonSupport Thanks , I’m just wondering is Univision a must carry channel ?
@VerizonSupport Is Verizon even trying to settle with Univision? I though Univision is a must carry channel ?
@VerizonSupport That’s what I’m using. I’m on a desktop not a phone just to clarify. When I️ click login via tv provider and choose Verizon I️ don’t ever reach a website it’s a completely white screen
@VerizonSupport No the screen just goes white
@VerizonSupport Your website gateway is broken and I️ can’t get to a login screen
@VerizonSupport Then provide the NESNgo app like the other providers, or I will take my business to them https://t.co/I6xKipC0kT
@VerizonSupport This has been ongoing since April and it is unacceptable.
@VerizonSupport $4.99
@VerizonSupport Wonder woman. .it just said you have a free movie to rent the price had to be no more that $4.99?
@VerizonSupport rent
@VerizonSupport Super wack . I got charged for a free movie that was supposed to be a gift too
@VerizonSupport My Verizon
@VerizonSupport I'm good. It's just what I witnessed with my friend and he was on the phone for 2 hrs trying to credit he was owed too. He did finally.
@VerizonSupport It’s resolved now, I’m just famished so tysm
@VerizonSupport Thanks. Want switch to your WiFi Bc @116021 sucks but we don’t want a homephone sooo guess we’ll stick with them.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport You understand you’re the least reliable and most expensive? ^CAR (what does that even mean)
@VerizonSupport Is there an outage in the NYC area.? Most of my channels are scrambling.
@VerizonSupport Thank you for the update! I'm relieved to know it's just a glitch. Was nervous there for a while.
@VerizonSupport @127621 my cat and I are in NY
@VerizonSupport Wifi and with a WiFi extender. WiFi signal has so far been 5x5. I dont think wifi is the problem. All devices are slow.
@VerizonSupport 2 macbooks are in use. Not actively in use, but connected, are 2 iPhones, 1 iPad, and 1 Sony 65" Bravia TV.
@VerizonSupport I do not have a Cat5 or Cat 6 cable ethernet cable.
@VerizonSupport I should also add that I live out in the country. Nearest house about 50-75 meters away. So wifi channel interference is not an issue.
@VerizonSupport Upload &gt; than Download? https://t.co/MjOtLbQBEU
@VerizonSupport 2.4Ghz test https://t.co/RKsxw7gPsu
@VerizonSupport I can't easily disconnect the tv from wifi.
@VerizonSupport Tv is not connected. Which is odd. This is the new 2.4G test. Moderate improvement. https://t.co/zsxpx6rJky
@VerizonSupport Much better!!!!! https://t.co/2EKgq5fm2v
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the help!
@VerizonSupport Both my macbooks and my iphone are connected to the 5Ghz
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Thank you- it seems to be working
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport I think it'd be more mobile service? I got a new phone but the employees suck at communicating and treat me like an idiot. Can I DM you?
@VerizonSupport No, I do not dare use our wifi on my phone. This is in relation to my TV, Xbox and laptop.
@VerizonSupport Oh we have an internet connection, barely! We have yet to see our connection go above two bars.
@VerizonSupport Resedential. Was told had a tech appointment never got confirm trying to figure it out
@VerizonSupport Already spent too much time with you guys today.
@VerizonSupport Your staff have used harsh language with me.  Lie, Ignore, and he Wasted my time.
@VerizonSupport mobile account
@VerizonSupport Yes. To any service, actually. Just says “Searching”
@VerizonSupport Like WiFi? Yes, it does.
@VerizonSupport Chula Vista, CA and no from my knowledge nobody has Verizon.
@VerizonSupport Cellular.
@VerizonSupport Oh, and phone connection refuses to work. However, T-mobile's interface says only 40 up/down potential. Never had this problem with @116021
@VerizonSupport "There appears to be something impacting the speed to your router. Click on the link below to troubleshoot." claims 147 up 151 down
@VerizonSupport Wireless. And changing channels did not help. Internal testing is biased. Thus independent connection used.
@VerizonSupport Cell 3x a day. Everyday
@VerizonSupport Residential. If its an outage in the hampton rds area, is it possible for you ti send out an alert?
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/oHET4nxSbP
@VerizonSupport Yes it is.
@VerizonSupport No video still. Same issue.
@VerizonSupport This isn’t a single tv problem.  It’s a whole house problem.  None of the TVs are working
@VerizonSupport Nothing at all and no help from customer service
@VerizonSupport It just says on the tv “channel xx is currently unavailable”
@VerizonSupport Currently no tv service.  Did a reset of the fios box.
@VerizonSupport It's been too long. I've missed you.
@VerizonSupport I sent the DM to the Verizon and followed.
@VerizonSupport Is it to the official Verizon page? Because I did.
@VerizonSupport Wells Fargo. And I have used this multiple times and I’ve not experienced any issues until now. And I recently made a purchase a few minutes ago with the same card, and I had no issues. I am refraining from calling to make the payment, due to the $3 fee.
@VerizonSupport I fill out the info as normal. Type in the payment amount, then the payment method which is debit card. Fill out the info, then when it’s asking to submit, I hit submit and it gives me the “error, try again later or use another payment method.”
@VerizonSupport I do not use the app. I go to the actual website. https://t.co/wtMyZIx480
@VerizonSupport Home bill. I use Verizon bill pay.
@VerizonSupport Desktop, dsl from phone line, dry loop
@VerizonSupport I told you how this can be resolved as I told the rep I spoke with but yet you want to educate me.
@VerizonSupport No I'm good thanks too much time wasted with this already.  Time is money tick tock @VerizonSupport
@VerizonSupport Like I said can I get my last hour back. If you can't give me that you can't help.
@VerizonSupport No all I need is a replacement modem.  The 5ghz band is flakey at best.  Have to reboot modem weekly due to this and other speed issues
@VerizonSupport Yeah return the last hour of my life.  Train your reps to be empathetic.  And get a better automated system @VerizonSupport
@VerizonSupport I did no one is responding
@VerizonSupport Great in our DM. You just gave me the same number I have called since Sunday. An automated system with a 15 minute wait!  Huge help
@VerizonSupport Thanks. My problem actually was repaired through the troubleshooter on the website.
@VerizonSupport When I check the outage map is this a bad sign https://t.co/IQ8cbH6v8M
@VerizonSupport Verizon computers shut us down by mistake Sunday afternoon. Internet phone and tv.  Getting service back up has been a NOGHTMARE. As of today I have internet and still no tv.   Working with someone again this am who is telling me he hasn’t give my back my dvd services.
@VerizonSupport Sorry. Didn't see this. The show itself. Thanks
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport I’m not sure actually. I have an agent with me now, but we may have to start the hour over.
@VerizonSupport All TVs, and shows on TLC - 90 day fiancé is one
@VerizonSupport Honestly I'd rather just have a call than all this talk on twitter. But they show up as a choice. The sound doesn't work correctly. I reported it twice. I just want it fixed, if you can't fix it I would like money taken off my next bill. The service agent on the phone was awful.
@VerizonSupport Nothing, she said she couldn't do anything. I asked to speak to a manager and she refused, then said someone would call me back within an hour. They called me back today when I was at work and couldn't speak.
@VerizonSupport I did it all, myself and with your tech support.
@VerizonSupport I think I'm in. I should be signing in tonight.
@VerizonSupport I have time now and am at the cart. I do not have that model number and do not need the rental of the router, is it fine if I press continue?
@VerizonSupport I chatted with rep. I am in!!! Have to wait a week :( Will check to see if anything opens earlier.
@VerizonSupport Chatting with a rep now. Thanks.
@VerizonSupport They want me to do a secure chat on Facebook but I need a link.
@VerizonSupport And supposedly you’ve made your bills easier to read. I notice no change and when I click the link to see the changes, it’s a dead link
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport no i am considering adding it to my FIOS triple play
@VerizonSupport No. It’s the onhub connected to the fios fueled Ethernet cable.
@VerizonSupport Still terrible. I dare you to fix this
@VerizonSupport It righted itself after multiple attempts. This is a chronic problem, sometimes lasts all day.
@VerizonSupport 100% of the time we try to watch something on demand the video and audio breaks up. I’ve called about it at least 4 times. I’ve unplugged everything 726 times and followed your instructions. Problem not solved. Plus, your on demand selection is embarrassing.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I don’t know. We only watch on demand on one. We’ve run into trouble with the same (roughly) dozen channels every time this happens. And I’m sent through the same trouble shooting process. Question is, why am I always having trouble
@VerizonSupport What’re those people called that go to customers houses to do these things? Techs? Are they not a thing anymore. Are customers now the techs?
@VerizonSupport currently but will reach out on DM at soonest opportunity.  Spoke with rep earlier and she was looking for update from engineer escalation team.  thanks!
@VerizonSupport Yes I can do that
@VerizonSupport I am referring to my WiFi at home
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport @115990 No need I will be transferring to a different provider when I’m off work. This is unacceptable
@VerizonSupport They never completed our auto pay or paperless when we transferred off family plan. We gave this over phone to Verizon rep. I was also awarded a $45 credit for the next three months due to data issues. And one line was supposed to be disconnected end of October that wasn’t.
@VerizonSupport Incompetent people. I am going to switch providers after work. Absolutely absurd and rude. I’m in actually dumbfounded at how they’re speaking to me right now. Unbelievable
@VerizonSupport Yes two boxes, it appears to be just this box/TV combo.
@VerizonSupport One TV and the main box. Happens to different channels.
@VerizonSupport yes!
@VerizonSupport Nope!
@VerizonSupport It's a new TV, so I've noticed it maybe 10-25% of the time it happens.
@VerizonSupport I got a human on the phone
@VerizonSupport Mobile service. Check my acct you will see the notes and the guarantee that I would be repaid for previous mistake by YOUR COMPANY! And now they blatantly disrespect me like this. I am disgusted
@VerizonSupport I had an agreement with you to fix a major issue and after a thousand attempts it was resolved. You forced me to pay the next 2 months only to be completely taken advantage of again! I have never felt so disrespected!!!!
@VerizonSupport slide in my dms https://t.co/fkCsk2lI7Y
@VerizonSupport The first date available :D just seeing if there's a secret way to get an even earlier date
@VerizonSupport I have reset. Only the HD box is having the issue. Of course :-)
@VerizonSupport Power light on, nothing else
@VerizonSupport Neither. I'm having trouble with the statement released today saying you support Net Neutrality and repealing Title II protections. How do you expect Net Neutrality protections to be enforced without Title II protections, given  the 2015 federal appeals court ruling?
@VerizonSupport wireless.
@VerizonSupport i have tried that as well. my connection is still poor.
@VerizonSupport i have also tried the wifi analyzer as well...
@VerizonSupport 50MBPS.
@VerizonSupport YO, you cant look at my account info and see wtf is going on with my account. DAMN!
@VerizonSupport soooooo you’re telling me that your service aren’t what you guys display on television? that i’m not guaranteed reliable wifi services? you’re saying it’s a hit or miss with your wireless internet? you’re telling me i should switch services?
@VerizonSupport thanks for the chat and not being able to help me with my service. #beblessed
@VerizonSupport in the master bedroom. and i’m trying to access it in the master bedroom. like right now the service is being interfered. i think i’m going to have to switch providers!
@VerizonSupport 48.50
@VerizonSupport i’ve done that as well MULTIPLE times.
@VerizonSupport my internet speed &amp; connection. i’ve rest and restored the modem and it’s still working poorly. 🤬
@VerizonSupport Now announcing outage in my area. My I.pagination or are these becoming more frequent??
@VerizonSupport 5:48 but it seems to be fixed...for the moment.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport half our channels are working so that won’t help the issue
@VerizonSupport it is bravo and all hd channels
@VerizonSupport it’s live tv and yes it is happening on all of them
@VerizonSupport @142065 I'm a customer.  You will not bring fiber here anytime soon.  And I'm outside of Boston, very tech heavy.
@VerizonSupport @143012 Expanding? Buffalo, NY is still waiting on FIOS, even after Verizon was gifted dark fiber to bring it to Buffalo...
@VerizonSupport No, you're not.  Verizon said Buffalo will never get FIOS, because it has to be installed city wide in a reasonable amount of time.

Even after Verizon was gifted dark fiber, with the promise they would build out.
@VerizonSupport Sorry. Still getting "no signal."
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/OeB2716zbk
@VerizonSupport already do
@VerizonSupport No. Theres a million wires and plugs back there.
@VerizonSupport I just did it. Then I made sure it was on HDMI. Then I got this. https://t.co/X27dgy4N0L
@VerizonSupport You guys said we have to make an appt cuz u guys are upgrading in our area else our phone service will be interrupted. I called 3 different days and 3 diff times and can't get an appt.
@VerizonSupport There are no outages in my area. The TV works fine. It’s just the internet. This always happens. Please help me with this issue. Shoot a signal to my router https://t.co/JqQew9kVLV
@VerizonSupport It’s fixed
@VerizonSupport No. It just keeps blinking. The WiFi light isn’t on. The earth light keeps blinking
@VerizonSupport home-office-solutions/wireless-home-phone
@VerizonSupport Yes. Yes.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport I have four cordless phones but only one actually uses a phone jack. The other three are plugged into an electric outlet.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Now disconnected cordless and attached corded. There's a dial tone but not ringing when I call.
@VerizonSupport Yes it's on. On all the phones.
@VerizonSupport I do follow and DMed earlier.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Now what?
@VerizonSupport yes
@VerizonSupport power is verified i just need cable and wifi
@VerizonSupport black
@VerizonSupport okay i did
@VerizonSupport Got it. Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Cant seem to connect to internet. We've rebooted the router few times, no connection
@VerizonSupport Yes, we're on the phone with Verizon now. Back up battery has been removed, no internet. We're scheduling a visit tomorrow
@VerizonSupport ty
@VerizonSupport Everything is secure. This pops up every other minute. Have hard reset the VMS several times along with the local box. https://t.co/bvARgCbkqc
@VerizonSupport On all tvs all channels but one. Hard reset the vms 4 times and nothing.
@VerizonSupport Yes that’s the first thing I did and I did it 16 times
@VerizonSupport It just never works
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport I have no clue what that is
@VerizonSupport I could look. I don’t understand why the internet is so bad though. I lose connection all the time
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport Yeah
@VerizonSupport No, after i hold the front button it was red last night tho
@VerizonSupport In the living room
@VerizonSupport Yes but fios doesn't show up on the connection list.

@VerizonSupport Thank you for your help.
@VerizonSupport Yes!
@VerizonSupport Thanks again and great job!
@VerizonSupport Cable box light is still red.
@VerizonSupport Yes it’s green
@VerizonSupport This box? https://t.co/eJ4x7NeSKF
@VerizonSupport Just did a third reboot and no luck. Still red. Also went to check main box in basement and all is green there.
@VerizonSupport Cool, is there a site that doesn't require my blood type and my zodiac sign to figure out if service is available?
@VerizonSupport Residential home wifi!
@VerizonSupport I’m not sure how to navigate this page! Help plz :) https://t.co/9Z4gcrrZdA
@VerizonSupport I don't know what that is. Can you explain?
@VerizonSupport I want to cancel my service but cant get past the IVR. Can you give me a call
@VerizonSupport Everytime i call the music starts playing and then hangs up within 2 minutes. Please give me a call and transfer me to someone. I want to cancel my service. If you dont help me cancel my service I will report this and I will file a law suit
@VerizonSupport Then how did i get a outbound call from someone. Your fucking customer service line is taking forever to answer.
@VerizonSupport Residential.
@VerizonSupport Yes , I’m wondering what the newest model dvr is, the volume is not working on mine, I just tried everything, reboot cables my game system is giving volume
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport Green
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport It worked. Thanks! Can always trust Verizon.
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the help.
@VerizonSupport Still showing this. https://t.co/sCgo0HmBMv
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/WKZSxBDHao
@VerizonSupport The back of the card literally says to apply to your bill go online. Why would you send me a gift card if I can’t use it?
@VerizonSupport Repair techs on phone tell me there's an order for my line deletion today. Forward me to customer service billing to resolve that issue. But that department is closed today. My 20yr old business line is going to be deleted today by Verizon's incompetence. HELP. @115725
@VerizonSupport We can do that over email or call me directly instead of making me wait again
@VerizonSupport Look at the issue and email the email on file for the a/c. I've already verified in the chat with screenshots DMd to you yesterday and you've already looked at my account this morning. I don't need to wait on hold again for your chat to tell me nothing. I can get that in email.
@VerizonSupport Last week
@VerizonSupport Jamaica Plain, ma 02130 off center street
@VerizonSupport Nevermind. Your boy in upstate New York finally answered. He was actually quite nice! Just wish it didn't take so long. Peace out.
@VerizonSupport Sure. They’re random and all seemingly my local AC and exchange.
@VerizonSupport It’s not strong upstairs.
@VerizonSupport We have FIOS
@VerizonSupport Same as with the original router both the globe and the WiFi symbol are white
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport On my cell
@VerizonSupport Im paying 170 a month for just internet and cable with only 4 boxes and only 1 is hd.... I can get 4 boxes hd and internet from spectrum 80 dollars cheaper
@VerizonSupport You guys are garbage im still on hold for over and I had to call back. I'm done with you!!
@VerizonSupport Cell
@VerizonSupport Landline.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport WiFi
@VerizonSupport Or at least help me?
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport mobile phone account
@VerizonSupport Yes she is please DM me for details
@VerizonSupport Yes...
@VerizonSupport We've been on call with "customer no care" for one hour over fraudulent Jamaica call
@VerizonSupport It's for a wireless account
@VerizonSupport The latest detail is that your customer support manager Lian hung up on me.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Still nothing Jay, an hour later.  No progress, no help.
@VerizonSupport No, I'm speaking with an agent but no agent that I've spoken with has been able to fix the problem.  Everyone is very great at saying that they're "sorry", but it's all meaningless.
@VerizonSupport No, they are instead making excuses as to why Verizon is allowed to no-show to tech visits and why promised manager call-backs don't happen like they are supposed to.
@VerizonSupport I'll let her know and pass the baton.  Hopefully someone can explain why her bill increased without her knowledge or consent.
@VerizonSupport I hope so!
@VerizonSupport Yes it is, sometimes it will stay white but with no connection, tried to reset to factory default with no custom settings, the tests the tech did were inconclusive, said we will be receiving a call to upgrade the ONT
@VerizonSupport Just this app.
@VerizonSupport Today I go on to watch hbo on demand and the picture isn’t coming in and I get an error message
@VerizonSupport I don't know what the difference is. Its not plugged into the wall like when I had AT&amp;T but I don't think it goes thru my internet.
@VerizonSupport There shouldn't be a list, especially in or around Baltimore. Police are constantly telling people to be on the lookout for fake sales people canvasing houses.
@VerizonSupport Not One of the tickets Has Ever been corrected your cust serv just apologizes. I’m still waiting for DVR service, app still not up to par &amp; this is all since oct 27 #Fail
@VerizonSupport I have DM you several times. Spoken on the phone And On chat. Your Service doesn’t deliver !! Internet is faster but we needed an extender (which is extra$) AND NOTHING ELSE WORKS!!
@VerizonSupport ??????what is ACM
@VerizonSupport I will know for sure mon. Who do I contact to speak to someone? ? I am on Long Island.
@VerizonSupport Yes, thinking about switching. Will have to talk to rep.
@VerizonSupport I have DSL.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/Ow1G6IOG8Y
@VerizonSupport I see how it’s done- I’ll try now
@VerizonSupport That did not work
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport And I’ve restarted laptop each time
@VerizonSupport What do you mean by wired?
@VerizonSupport Yes- same problem
@VerizonSupport Think my tweet didn’t go thru. Please advise on next steps. https://t.co/xjdhcIXzKv
@VerizonSupport Works now, thank you.
@VerizonSupport Don’t believe there is one? I just see this and nothing else out of the ordinary connected to it.
@VerizonSupport Did that multiple times, same result.
@VerizonSupport I don’t have the account info because I’m visiting Home for the holidays. Please see photo for router lights. https://t.co/l0JimKr1CG
@VerizonSupport Wrong link, I already have Verizon. Tried to hard restart my modem and both the world (?) icon and WiFi icons are blinking red.
@VerizonSupport Fixed it thank you
@VerizonSupport 3 days was too long. Nobody follows up. I am the one doing the follow ups, and getting nowhere
@VerizonSupport How? You just told the whole world mine was down now on Twitter what’s the difference
@VerizonSupport You should really warn your customers before hand and set a better expectation. My box says 15 mins... #fail
@VerizonSupport I tried several times and even unplugged evenerhthing for 30 seconds.
@VerizonSupport I get a message saying update in progress. Will be done in 15 mins. still not working Why am I even paying for this! Comcast had no issues.
@VerizonSupport hey, i already tried this and it doesn't work :-/
@VerizonSupport can you please email me a pre-paid shipping label?
@VerizonSupport After speaking with your team 3 times already, you STILL haven’t sent my label. What is the hold up? Why can’t this be emailed?
@VerizonSupport Looks like we might. Someone from my office will call you this afternoon. Thank you. Really appreciate your responsiveness!
@VerizonSupport Thx. That link isn’t working. Do you mind resending?
@VerizonSupport Thank you, Verizon. Hope your service is available in our building. Dealing with @127249 @comcastcares has been a nightmare.
@VerizonSupport Yes and I’m getting the same error code
@VerizonSupport Needle wires? You mean the quad shield RG-6 that worked perfectly with direct tv when I installed it? Yes! It's fine!
@VerizonSupport Right, please go on... explain signal to noise ratio when every other channel works. I'll wait...
@VerizonSupport So when I was watching espn for the last few weeks and it was fine, my splitter was good.
@VerizonSupport Ok, why is it selective to big events and perfect all day for sports center?
@VerizonSupport Right, the more important the game or pay per view, the hotter the copper gets. Now I get it. So you take no responsibility for this issue?
@VerizonSupport Nope
@VerizonSupport No, just when I'm charged $70 for tiling and games I want to watch- never on yes channel though
@VerizonSupport Not sure about ppv, but yes on espn
@VerizonSupport Your hotspot check your dms I've already heard from support  it's just the run around since you started screwing customers who got unlimited
@VerizonSupport Home
@VerizonSupport No need for that. I was on the phone with multiple representatives and that did not help not one bit. Comcast is the move.
@VerizonSupport Thanks. 🖖🖖
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Red. I restarted it. The cable connections are fine
@VerizonSupport No internet access atm
@VerizonSupport we did that about a week ago and it still does it. should i get new cables?
@VerizonSupport Yes,I frequently restart both of my boxes and they’re fine for a few days,but then they start acting up again.
@VerizonSupport Yes and it was freezing. 😔
@VerizonSupport I do not have a Verizon acct. A fraudulent Verizon Wireless acct was opened in my name &amp; just reported on my credit report.
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the quick reply.  I'm not home right now, but will try this later this evening.  I have the Arris VMS1100 DVR model.
@VerizonSupport that’s not the question I asked.
@VerizonSupport If Access to https://t.co/FGziyL2j5C was included with a Center Ice subscription. This is included on the DirecTV Center Ice subscription.
@VerizonSupport I had to upgrade last night to get them - from basic to Premium - an add'l $40 per month.  Spike, ESPN, CNBC, etc.
@VerizonSupport May / June. I complained about this within a week and was told I needed to upgrade - so I didnt.  Bit the bullet yesterday.
@VerizonSupport 2) When i signed up - i asked that FIOS give me the same level of options at a cheaper monthly cost.
@VerizonSupport you really want to know?
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport Also hung up on me and were extremely rude
@VerizonSupport Someone called Verizon to change the name on my account and no one has any information to give me about this situation.
@VerizonSupport I already tried this earlier this week. Want to watch preseason basketball and can’t on league pass.
@VerizonSupport Yes dip shit
@VerizonSupport New York , queens
@VerizonSupport I just tried again on my laptop and Facebook works but anytime I open a link from FB it gives me the same error.
@VerizonSupport Yes if I turn off my WiFi and turn on my data, the articles open.
@VerizonSupport I would think it's my home account because it seems to be a problem with the Wi-Fi.
@VerizonSupport Both.
@VerizonSupport I have one tv.
@VerizonSupport Everything each time. They're all plugged into the same outlet.
@VerizonSupport Yes. But overall the quality has degraded. Digital "static" and glitches when playing On Demand shows. Unacceptable based on how much I pay.
@VerizonSupport It's happened with all different networks and premium channels
@VerizonSupport As I said earlier I have only one TV
@VerizonSupport You have to buy things on demand; I went to watch Hostel III and the English version cost money but the Spanish version was free
@VerizonSupport I only have internet so yes. Are there advanced notices provided anywhere?
@VerizonSupport Having advanced notices would be extremely helpful!
@VerizonSupport New Jersey
@VerizonSupport Wish I knew about that before I worked on my paper. At least now I have an excuse as to why I couldn't finish it
@VerizonSupport I did, what doI do from here ?
@VerizonSupport The problem isnt the speed, its the consistency of it. theres always frequent lag and ping spikes and often says theres no int connection
@VerizonSupport Yes it is, and apparently it's supposed to be the gigabit connection
@VerizonSupport Everytime I click sign in, I only get please wait and it keeps refreshing itself. I've signed in before on this phone and have had np
@VerizonSupport There is, but the other end went to an old desktop I haven't used in years so I doubt it was doing anything
@VerizonSupport Done, then disconnected power for 10 seconds and plugged back in. After a min or 2 modem goes back to red light, still no internet.
@VerizonSupport I do
@VerizonSupport Ok, thank you very much for the assistance and information, I appreciate it!
@VerizonSupport Yes, I've tried rebooting a few times and it will blink white for a min or 2 then go back to red
@VerizonSupport both, so I assume it's most of the channels I paid for.
@VerizonSupport one or two free
@VerizonSupport I didn't give my credentials
@VerizonSupport you buy those channels for a price. Which I did. I gave you money to have all content. Well it's not there
@VerizonSupport @158221 Please get Fibre Optic to all areas of PA as FAST as you can!
@VerizonSupport Not available in my area.
@VerizonSupport Router reset didn't work, but the box reset did. Thank you!
@VerizonSupport I know you say that each time Same topic since March NO resolution! Waiting for a call now already a little late!
@VerizonSupport The service rep behavior wasn't acceptable. They can't tell on us
@VerizonSupport cellular
@VerizonSupport They both suck
@VerizonSupport My damn 13 year old son could have answered my damn question!! Fios and your wireless people who work from you must not be educated
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Thank you, would it be possible to send a text next time? :)
@VerizonSupport Not sure why it didnt. Not the first time. But I work alot and that show is my relax time
@VerizonSupport Absolutely,  thanks for checking in.. appreciate it
@VerizonSupport It is set as scheduled,  not sure what happened. I am going to see next week if happens again.
@VerizonSupport Thank you
@VerizonSupport yeah all connections are fine. All channels are coming in.
@VerizonSupport Once AGAIN, no fucking help from support. Don’t fuckin tell me to DM you and then spend several minutes asking for bullshit after I gave it
@VerizonSupport No because I’m still missing certain channels.
@VerizonSupport I’m done. It took less than 30 days for crap to start happening. I’m cancelling service.
@VerizonSupport What the hell is going on with your service? This crap keeps happening and it’s too expensive.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/4ewbaXW6ce
@VerizonSupport Currently using Verizion Fios.
@VerizonSupport Pretty much always been. Got tired of suffering in silence. I unplug the damned thing weekly in hopes a reset will forestall the worst of it
@VerizonSupport Locks up constantly, in different ways. Takes too long to load DVR menu. DVR scheduling takes forever. Delays responding to remote commands.
@VerizonSupport Need to think about it and see if DTV will fix their problem.  But am considering
@VerizonSupport We just had Fios installed for wifi. Stayed with DTV for Sunday ticket.
@VerizonSupport Yea but I’m not spending all day messing with this crap to only have two or three working channels and have to mess with the coaxial.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport I’m done. Im canceling service and going back to @119000
@VerizonSupport That tweet was intended for @119000. I’m cancelling my FIOS services since I’m within my 30 days.
@VerizonSupport I am WAAYY pass that... and sick of being transferred... waiting on a supervisor to "call back"
@VerizonSupport I was told id get double play &amp; custom tv why do i have about 15 channels none of which i discussed and being told i have local package
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport 2/2 it's weird too that it's not just you guys -- it's CitiCards and Capital One too, all at the same time.
@VerizonSupport I get a message saying that the channel is unavailable. That amongst many others, I only have TNT
@VerizonSupport I know of others in my area are having problems.  And I don't have time to troubleshoot, unless I can charge you an hourly rate for my work.
@VerizonSupport DSL....Dang Slow Loading.  Y'all don't have FiOS in our area...my closest neighbor is 1500ft away.
@VerizonSupport The price went up but the speed did not.
@VerizonSupport My guy Taylor got it straight! Thanks!
@VerizonSupport Really?  Every person I chatted with said they couldn't call me. And then after wasting so much of my time the gave me a number to call.
@VerizonSupport I just wasted an hour of my vacation trying to get assistance from you. Why would I think that anything would get better now???
@VerizonSupport OK, I followed you, but don't see the DM link
@VerizonSupport residential
@VerizonSupport Yes — but the question is, why doesn’t @115722 include all fees in advertised cost? Intentionally leaving them out isn’t misleading? 🤔
@VerizonSupport Knowing they will be included, why isn’t @115722 more transparent &amp; include “Verizon Surcharges &amp; Fees” in the advertised Bundle cost?
@VerizonSupport Again, not surprised — just disappointed in @115722 misleading w/ actual cost. Why not include ALL Verizon fees in cost advertised?
@VerizonSupport Like I said, I understand the fees. Disappointed w/ the misleading advertisements similar to the business practices of a used care salesman
@VerizonSupport Who should i speak to
@VerizonSupport 1/3 inquired about transferring buss serv to new address. never committed to serv but was sent equip. tried to return.
@VerizonSupport Not from the info I received from cust serv.  I'd say this is cramming!!
@VerizonSupport Currently heading to lunch and the gym, will be back at around 5:15. Thanks for the help so far.
@VerizonSupport not sure.... how can i check? thanks, again!
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the help. Hopefully I can find the right price.
@VerizonSupport $179, no contract, and top package with all premium channels.
@VerizonSupport Match the Spectrum price and we'd be back in a heartbeat!
@VerizonSupport No. It was for a service call one of st least 7 I've had since switching, not counting all the times I've had to call due to issues.
@VerizonSupport Can you DM. It's another issue in need help with. Thanks
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/9Z9JYUKwWw
@VerizonSupport I only have Internet.
@VerizonSupport yes the globe had a red light
@VerizonSupport no wifi. Have restarted etc and nothing. Is connecting to my wifi but no internet.
@VerizonSupport up and running. Thanks.
@VerizonSupport Did a hard reset and it is loading now
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/yAz0CpR4um
@VerizonSupport VAES089970
@VerizonSupport Only in IE.
@VerizonSupport You owe me a $250 Verizon gift card for signing up for FIOS. One was sent but I didn’t get it. I need old one voided and new one sent.
@VerizonSupport Having horrible problems with my Internet on my mobile device
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/CzTeHy8weh
@VerizonSupport @168159 1. Why was she on the phone for almost an hour?
2. Why would she wanna be helped via tweets?
#TwitterFingers
@VerizonSupport Thank you @VerizonSupport  we would like to thank Jalen for helping us - he went above and beyond and is a true gentleman.
@VerizonSupport will you actually give me gigabit speeds? comcast lies right to my face
@VerizonSupport it is, do you actually get the speeds around 800 down and up..
@VerizonSupport comcast lies i’m about to switch the most i got was 500 and 60
@VerizonSupport Ok thank you i’ll probably be switching, comcast gigabit as trash
@VerizonSupport Yes, we would supply our own
@VerizonSupport Oh man. Ok thank you.
@VerizonSupport @115725 I dont have time to waste on this.
@VerizonSupport You haven't  resolved it with the 2 previous tests.  Ive lost enough time trying to get better service.  But @115725 is my only option.
@VerizonSupport Yes!
@VerizonSupport I think I'm on my way back!
@VerizonSupport I spoke with an associate by the name of Samora in either Charlotte, NC or California call center she works in Gift Crad hung up on me.
@VerizonSupport Do you mean router? If so, how do I do that?
@VerizonSupport No improvement whatsoever. #ReallyGettingAnnoyed https://t.co/Pk5iBHr6aC
@VerizonSupport Yes. On the ground behind the TV. Boyfriend has it screwed to the wall. https://t.co/dHG8Mj3Foe
@VerizonSupport I'm fed up and tired. Will try all that tomorrow. Maybe by then it will have fixed itself. #wishfulthinking
@VerizonSupport Oh it's definitely time to give up. Now the TV says I'm not subscribed to TBS. #EveryoneIsSubscribedToTBS https://t.co/09qcMeOBIo
@VerizonSupport Only one TV in the house, so no.
@VerizonSupport Screen stuck on "preparing network connection" - reconnected first one and was fine. JOKE!
@VerizonSupport No! Only one location for set top box. Why keep this service? NO HELP!
@VerizonSupport Yes that is correct, still does not work.  Cannot connect. #lost #dontgetverizoned
@VerizonSupport The connection works fine, first box connects and DVR is broke (told to me by Verizon), second can't connect. BAD SERVICE!
@VerizonSupport It can't connect to the network, @82272 tech support of no help and try to schedule maintenance call. Not happening- BAD SERVICE!
@VerizonSupport Its back now! Probably just a hiccup. Thank you for your speedy reply!
@VerizonSupport Change the on demand menu back to the way it was... 😂😂😂😂😂
@VerizonSupport Georgia
@VerizonSupport I guess I figured it would just “kick in” in next day or so? It didn’t really clarify.
@VerizonSupport Modem was definitely up as I could log into after it was power cycled. None of my devices (wired/wireless) would connect.
@VerizonSupport I didn't really look, I just power cycled the router with no effect. After 20 min it was restored. Then it dropped again for 5min
@VerizonSupport Currently I am up with no red lights. This has happened in the past when Vz performs maintenance. FYI i WFH
@VerizonSupport Brooklyn, NY
@VerizonSupport Unfortunately, I didn't check while my internet was down. Currently, everything is up and appears to be stable.
@VerizonSupport Stuck on swirling symbol https://t.co/Lx1MuPSQPF
@VerizonSupport Yea,  it works fine on app on phone. But pc. Forget it. So annoying
@VerizonSupport No, and this is a brand new computer. Not the pc. Windows 10 edge. An  Omen computer.
@VerizonSupport Unfortunately,the app is now giving me red circle swirling. Then plays then does the swirling again,hard to watch something that keeps that
@VerizonSupport it's a red one on top white at bottom
@VerizonSupport Ok,  just checked and service back. Thanks for help anyway!
@VerizonSupport Vaguely. Will resetting that help if the problem is at your end?
@VerizonSupport account is locked
@VerizonSupport No no, everything is fine. Thanks.
@VerizonSupport See above thread, bot. Thx.
@VerizonSupport Will I be getting the $200? I also just got an email offering the $200 for trading in my s6
@VerizonSupport If I made the order on 9/12 and the rate expired 9/21, why would I not be getting the promotional rate?
@VerizonSupport The add-on charges are above and beyond the $99.99 bundle.  I asked for the $79.99 promotion and received the $99.99 rate.  Fix this?
@VerizonSupport Cart number below.  Why was I sent a mailer and charged a different price?  That's bait-and-switch. https://t.co/wsXdec4n08
@VerizonSupport I found it, it lists the $99.99 price; when I called and asked specifically for the $79.99 price mentioned in the mailer.  Why the change?
@VerizonSupport You sent me a flyer with a price which prompted me to purchase your services.  When I purchased them, you charged me a different price. Why?
@VerizonSupport I'm a new customer, though?
@VerizonSupport The new customer deal is $20 less than  the new customer deal I’m using.
@VerizonSupport I’ll never understand charging reliable customers /more/ for “renewal discounts” than for new customer discounts.
@VerizonSupport This seems silly when I already contacted support. You’d rather lose a customer than lower my price because “it’s only for new customers.”
@VerizonSupport no it just says activities
@VerizonSupport im not posting her bill on twitter, that is just dumb. I can send it to you
@VerizonSupport no, phone started working without anyone having to come
@VerizonSupport It says the channel is not authorized.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/HkAbVdulRZ
@VerizonSupport We only have cable on 1 TV so #yes it's happening on all of our tvs 📺
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport It goes to the “sleep” screen. Nothing blocking the vent
@VerizonSupport Yes. Still no good. Just had new wiring done to the house too. Was supposed to fix this. Nada.
@VerizonSupport This is by network also which is frustrating. Just saying. I would rely less on the search feature and try and figure out an on demand option for easier surfing.
@VerizonSupport It's hard to navigate the on demand user interface. Specifically looking through the movies. It's by genre, which is fine but A-Z? We gotta navigate with a remote lag too so it takes so much time to sift through
@VerizonSupport Ok so, it says "Sign in with:" and I choose "Repair Ticket Number and ZIP Code." I "sign in" successfully.

Then, it shows me the summary of the repair appt, and says "Sign In" again to make changes.

I click that, and it takes me to a page that reloads endlessly.

Please help.
@VerizonSupport Good job. Your tech just arrived 2 hours late. He is as apathetic as your customer service.
@VerizonSupport May I get more informatiom about this speed?
@VerizonSupport And I had to take UNPAID time off of work. I should not have to pay $150 install fee for awful customer service. I am contacting the BBB!
@VerizonSupport Ok. Do that please
@VerizonSupport I stream from my DVR away from home all the time. Are you saying to attempt to resolve I need to be home?
@VerizonSupport I am home now. What do I need to do?
@VerizonSupport Yes I do
@VerizonSupport I am out of home, connected to WiFi, app repeatedly says unable to connect to network. I can stream on all other apps. Not a WiFi issue.
@VerizonSupport Not achieving the speeds I was promised and your speed test tells me to contact you. I've tried chat but that failed too. Need my #bandwidth https://t.co/cUoxF8b63I
@VerizonSupport Wired from your FiOS equipment in my house. App states router test so assumption is it is from your router, not wifi. I pay for #gigabit.
@VerizonSupport Will do.
@VerizonSupport Wired. It's giving me the same results (as I expected it would) from your router to your backbone. https://t.co/SNqLe3OX6r
@VerizonSupport residential, not wireless. thanks.
@VerizonSupport Please DM me. I need to give you my phone number so someone from the US could help me, or I need to explain what I need.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Safari worked. Any plans to make your homepage work on Chrome..?
@VerizonSupport to wait on a tech and pay a fee when all the wires and equipment for installation is here and I'm a certified pcst (4/8)
@VerizonSupport that doesn't excuse nor explain why @115725 doesn't have a legitimate veterans discount... all I've been referred to (1/2)
@VerizonSupport high end user... the only reason my service wasn't instantly switched because I was sold gigabit internet now I have (3/8)
@VerizonSupport he called saying he would be here at 12.15pm. Over an hour later and nothing... https://t.co/eLEhKj86U9
@VerizonSupport @175907 Yo Verizon kudos to you guys for not airing the steelers game! Dey asss
@VerizonSupport We have DSL. But we are open to FIOS. We just don't think we get it in our area.
@VerizonSupport It is. It has been going on since last night but suddenly started working again. Was there an outage in New Stanton, Pennsylvania?
@VerizonSupport affecting all three of my TV's. All HD sports channels around it are fine.
@VerizonSupport Nope. My new apartment is not wired for it. How do I shut down my account? I'm still on hold....
@VerizonSupport Bradenton, FL
@VerizonSupport No the bein sports connect app. When I try and sign in with my VZ info it just buffers and if it works it tells me live tv isn’t available
@VerizonSupport Running a hardwired speed test averages us 75. But Ethernet should be good. Our wireless is awful
@VerizonSupport None. We received a new one within a year ago, all we did was set it up
@VerizonSupport 5 ghz
@VerizonSupport I just disconnected a extender, but that was hooked up to last router. This was most recent test https://t.co/BbeGiEQaab
@VerizonSupport Oh, lol wrong photo. But it was 14.99 and 3.13
@VerizonSupport @177284 @177285 Cable Card Manual Validation, ID: 000-061-340-420-1 ID Host: 035-0 13-011-740-0 Data Sheet: 276- 172-218-85
@VerizonSupport Yes and after an hour hold, every day, I'm told it'll be repaired tomorrow.
@VerizonSupport Whole neighborhood
@VerizonSupport No luck so far. @115725 social media rep was nice but can't do anything - just having a sales rep contact me within 48 hours.
@VerizonSupport I have no service. Wiring from outside was damaged. I need immediate repair
@VerizonSupport I have a technician scheduled for tomorrow but I really wanted one for right now!
@VerizonSupport Hum... anything that could cause slowdowns from @13324?
@VerizonSupport Yes we do.
@VerizonSupport Using our cells yes, think it's a landline number. Have used "1" and without. Get the "can't complete as dialed" message from verizon.
@VerizonSupport Not all of them,  mostly the higher channels.  Happening a lot now on MLB channel
@VerizonSupport Mainly the main TV in living room, but a little on others
@VerizonSupport Still doing it
@VerizonSupport That's beyond my knowledge about the cable set up
@VerizonSupport I paid $99 for the Mayweather fight,  had a house full of people,  and couldn't get the feed without major interruptions
@VerizonSupport PA
@VerizonSupport Look at my account... you just make up charges out of nowhere and drive up my bill to almost $900 , then you don't refund a deposit of $150
@VerizonSupport I dont get service hardly anymore
@VerizonSupport I really love it when you don't even tell me I'm being transferred
@VerizonSupport All over a bill that I haven't received and can't view online. You guys are awesome.
@VerizonSupport I am not.
@VerizonSupport When did this become a thing? I was watching for weeks. Why do I need an app to watch my DVR content at home, when I have my DVR at home?
@VerizonSupport Cell account.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I have tried to pay it today via My Fios but the option to pay via gift card is not available
@VerizonSupport How was your days going for you ^CAR
@VerizonSupport You always happen My days so happy ^CAR 😀
@VerizonSupport Do you like my new Twitter name ^CAR
@VerizonSupport Router is broken and I have to wait till tomorrow to get a new one ..sure my boss has no issues with me not getting work done today
@VerizonSupport via bank account- only verizon account. Doesn't help me when I don't have that information, since, you know, it's fraud.
@VerizonSupport It was never provided
@VerizonSupport I hope this works
@VerizonSupport Last time I spent almost 40 minutes on phone to get $20 refund (although they told me I will get $30 refund)
@VerizonSupport Do I have to pay for it
@VerizonSupport Says I hav to pay.ive had fios for yrs n if you look at my acct history you will see I've had lots of poor service..mayne it should be free
@VerizonSupport this happens because your servers are too busy!
@VerizonSupport tried 3 different browsers, all with the same result. its you not me.
@VerizonSupport Not on my TV, the website. "live tv" never works. I'm trying to watch on my computer.
@VerizonSupport When I try to login https://t.co/8lfH0o5c3I
@VerizonSupport I can't do that right now. I just think if you pay X amount of dollars per month something should work!
@VerizonSupport not working AGAIN. really ridiculous.
@VerizonSupport Yes I'm sick of it.
@VerizonSupport Yes and there's always an error.
@VerizonSupport trying to but taking an eternity
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/wu0IcbnsZg
@VerizonSupport turned phone off and iPad turned it back in- log in with exactly the same password and voila. Not sure what happened
@VerizonSupport I am redirected there after I login
@VerizonSupport Residental
@VerizonSupport Yes. Can access espn.
@VerizonSupport Yes but I’m going out
@VerizonSupport No. Just not recognizing my user name and password. I haven’t changed it. I also checked if I am logged into ESPN... that works
@VerizonSupport @179904 Same issue here trying to activate Fox Sports Go through Verizon SSO.
@VerizonSupport @179905 I am having the same issue
@VerizonSupport That is hard wired with wifi disabled since I thought it was just the wifi that was so poor for awhile
@VerizonSupport Sure, here's the result from that test https://t.co/6FDYW2SKHR
@VerizonSupport Well I don't know about a gigabit, but it can definitely handle more than 18.70Mbps, this gaming laptop is only 3 years old
@VerizonSupport I'm assuming it's the optimizer download to run on the machine? Ran it and restarting now.
@VerizonSupport Even worse now... https://t.co/Bdhb3I7IvX
@VerizonSupport Yes, I have several and they all have the same problem, the first was an Asus ROG laptop, this is a Dell Precision 5520. https://t.co/VFO8MnYjM4
@VerizonSupport Still the same after the reset https://t.co/Urimbj0M5B
@VerizonSupport That would be the first screenshot here, was the original with no active devices except my wired connection https://t.co/J2K0KhQyvZ
@VerizonSupport This is the wired test direct to the modem box today around the same time as the tests last night. https://t.co/jXWdChMHeK
@VerizonSupport It’s orange
@VerizonSupport Yes, even did a factory reset
@VerizonSupport Not working on Firefox mobile browser also
@VerizonSupport @180129 cannot log in using https://t.co/87kNtmmtoT or https://t.co/khzmcGhjpY
@VerizonSupport No. I even restarted the iPad.  I am missing the Patriots game due to this.  Resolve this now.
@VerizonSupport Can I get update  when gets fix
@VerizonSupport All green! https://t.co/v08DpF5Juh
@VerizonSupport Nope! Just the high speed internet.
@VerizonSupport Obviously have tried that like 5000 times- your site is having troubleshooting
@VerizonSupport Either that or it is just poorly implemented with the Fox Sports website, I can't tell
@VerizonSupport Not able to log in anywhere. No for https://t.co/avoVTFAA8X, no for the ESPN redirect, and no for the FS1 redirect.
@VerizonSupport Resolved, thank you
@VerizonSupport It's pixelated and skipping, sometimes shows a black screen. I tried resetting STB.
@VerizonSupport Yes just for the one channel
@VerizonSupport I already got it taken care of thru the Fios app. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport They’re not all using the network at the same time. Only 1-2. There are a couple of older laptops, but rarely used.
@VerizonSupport Right now, only using one device.
@VerizonSupport What do you mean by disconnect &amp; how? There are devices that apparently are listed but aren’t even currently turned on. Pls move this to DM.
@VerizonSupport I don’t know what that means. Please DM.
@VerizonSupport Done
@VerizonSupport …and you’ve said it’s because we have ~6 devices using the network, but that doesn’t seem like it should be an issue either.
@VerizonSupport Thanks. I have no wired devices. You’ve told us it’s b/c we use wifi at busy times but I have issues even at 6 AM…
@VerizonSupport Ok. Thank u verizon
@VerizonSupport I want the account number to my mobile phone account.
@VerizonSupport Had to switch to 2.4 like a savage.
@VerizonSupport Wireless on a Mac book
@VerizonSupport Tv, Like always it fixes itself after I miss something I can't go back to &amp; watch. Can I borrow the company time machine?
@VerizonSupport The set top box I was using was not the main box, howbeit it does have dvr capability. None of the packaged channels were working (15-20min)
@VerizonSupport after I went to the menu to try to troubleshoot, an error message eventually popped up
@VerizonSupport South Jersey
@VerizonSupport Yes, not getting The flyers game through my cable boxes on any TV in the house.
@VerizonSupport I already told you.
@VerizonSupport Only for Fios customers? I have friends with Comcast that are able to watch. And how am I able to watch on the NBC sports app if blackout
@VerizonSupport When I go to the Normal NBC station where it says the Flyers game is on, it is showing a different program.
@VerizonSupport Car Auctions.
@VerizonSupport No csn was 576. I have a friend who lives 10 minutes from me, he has fios and the game is running fine on his channel 576
@VerizonSupport Further from Philly. I literally live 15 minutes from the stadium that the Flyers play in.
@VerizonSupport Unfortunately I'll be leaving Fios then. This is pretty ridiculous
@VerizonSupport Thanks, bummer
@VerizonSupport Haven’t noticed commercials one way or the other, but DEFINITELY the Broadcast
@VerizonSupport No it is not - I guess it is a problem with the box.  I am currently watching Full Frontal in a different room.  Thanks, @VerizonSupport!
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport A tech is coming btwn 8-12tmw. I suggest you take a page out of @Ask_Spectrum book and provide 1hr windows instead.
@VerizonSupport Both, if possible. 92557
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/GXERABfMij
@VerizonSupport The only lights on there are the green PWR,  red FAIL and green blinking POTS
@VerizonSupport Done, its gone back to the same 3 lights as it was before reset.
@VerizonSupport power works fine at the outlet
@VerizonSupport All of the above!!
@VerizonSupport Only watching in my great room not every other room
@VerizonSupport I currently have FiOS and it is down
@VerizonSupport Aren’t you here to help? Help me watch golf.
@VerizonSupport DM me with the details.
@VerizonSupport Golf is a sport, no?
@VerizonSupport Verizon fios internet. The globe is red on my router &amp; I tried resetting it. The TV cable connection is fine
@VerizonSupport yes both lights in the back are green
@VerizonSupport tried that just now. Lights reset and flashed for ~1min, but globe is red again
@VerizonSupport I just tried and got an error saying I cannot message this account. I have followed. Am I missing something?
@VerizonSupport my 4G LTE has been useless the past week (same with my parents, sister, and brother in law. not on same plan either)
@VerizonSupport 5.0 GHz
@VerizonSupport Yes Fios in Brooklyn.
@VerizonSupport The router is in the wall. Behind a full closet and a metal plate that is screwed in. Not to mention MacBook has no Ethernet port.
@VerizonSupport I'm sure you would. However, we're all set now.
@VerizonSupport Yes what do I have to do
@VerizonSupport Globe is still red
@VerizonSupport Yes everything is on in the back of the router
@VerizonSupport It just randomly came back on thanks for the help
@VerizonSupport I'm not getting any internet connectivity and the router has a solid red globe on it.
@VerizonSupport Internet working again thanks!
@VerizonSupport I have, and I was only trying to add one single channel to watch a couple of basketball games, one of which is 1/4 of the way over already. All the deals involve adding like 100 channels.
@VerizonSupport yes, just clicked it. And does this plan apply to current customers who are out of contract?
@VerizonSupport It says $159 for two months. I returned the device within the 14 day return policy and shouldn't have to pay anything
@VerizonSupport I got a notification that my credit was hard pulled an hour later.
@VerizonSupport This is for my residential account
@VerizonSupport @115990 Okay. Thank you!
@VerizonSupport Cellular. I get the impression from the lady I talked to today, that it’s her cellular phone too.
@VerizonSupport My internet goes down at least once a day. There are many webpages I can't visit; this occurs erratically. Your automated phone svc is NUTS.
@VerizonSupport It it only my access to webpages, on &amp; off, my getting on to internet at all sometimes, &amp; the frequent interruptions of a Netflix movie.
@VerizonSupport None at all. I don't think it's possible. There's no switches.
@VerizonSupport Sorry, I do not understand your instructions.
@VerizonSupport How’s he got that internet
@VerizonSupport Thanks, but we just need internet connection...
@VerizonSupport Want to know why my bill is different every month up and down every month. Nothing the consistent every month paying a different amount.
@VerizonSupport My cellular service
@VerizonSupport The new one says “VZ 50-1” and I am in RI and they own half of the poles
@VerizonSupport No I do not. I never got a ticket. They showed up randomly after a bunch of calls. Please direct message me and I can give you the address
@VerizonSupport Yes. And it's happening on multiple devices.
@VerizonSupport Nope. That didn't work. Still having the same issue.
@VerizonSupport I kicked up a fuss to get connected to supervisor and downgrade svcs. You must let cust know that channel change leads to new contract.
@VerizonSupport @115990 You need to specify PST/EST on your call centers. Trying TOS and it says opens at 7am. EST/ PST? 611 working yet?
@VerizonSupport @115990 I'm through. Funny how one of the world's biggest phone companies had phone issues...
@VerizonSupport I was dialing 611 and the customer service number listed on line
@VerizonSupport My mobile bill is wrong. Trying to call to sort it out
@VerizonSupport I'm located in Miami...
@VerizonSupport cellular
@VerizonSupport The only options we have here are AT&amp;T and @1207.  They're the worst company I've even delt with.
@VerizonSupport I would imagine it's on the network to provide you guys with the episodes but the new season of AHS isn't on demand thus life has no meaning
@VerizonSupport call got picked up about 30s after your tweet, but thanks!
@VerizonSupport YES. I looK forward to a hefty credit in my $300/mo bill
@VerizonSupport Wired. Roku is plugged in w/ Ethernet cable.
@VerizonSupport Yes but I only have 1 Ethernet cable &amp; will not unplug it from Roku during the Michigan/Michigan State game in order to plug into my laptop.
@VerizonSupport Assuming speedtest is accurate only w/ Ethernet cable?
@VerizonSupport Download speed ranges 6.3-6.6 mbps. (I checked a few times.) Reload issue isn’t just tonight. It’s constant. Tonight is just more annoying.
@VerizonSupport Ok. I did that. What is it supposed to do?
@VerizonSupport So is it supposed to stop constantly “loading” now?
@VerizonSupport And now it’s “loading” &amp; frozen. For $66/month I should be able to watch a continuous 10 minutes of TV, don’t you think?
@VerizonSupport If problem isn’t solved, what’s the next step? (Update: it just did the “loading” thing 3x! Though it didn’t freeze. It reloaded itself.)
@VerizonSupport Cellular. The old grandfather unlimited account.
@VerizonSupport ticket #2496
@VerizonSupport Just got it done, thanks!
@VerizonSupport It's so slow.  It's horrible
@VerizonSupport Yes all.  Jet pack and phones.
@VerizonSupport My internet is fucking up
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport This is for a bill you guys are trying to collect. I need some info to help settle it. For my old Verizon home internet service.
@VerizonSupport Mobile.
@VerizonSupport Cell phone
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport Ive tried to talk for months. No progress, just the run around. 😒🤥
@VerizonSupport I was given the run around for months with no progress and slow service and a higher rate
@VerizonSupport Still no reply
@VerizonSupport I called and we’re outside your normal business hours but that’s weird as it’s not even 6pm on the East Coast?
@VerizonSupport The button buried? I honestly can't tell if I pressed it or just ruined my modem
@VerizonSupport Yeah that didn't work
@VerizonSupport I cannot change my account services online. I was told by your chat rep. that this is a technical support issue. How do I open a ticket?
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/dxRSSugLvh
@VerizonSupport Pre sale questions.
@VerizonSupport it's a blur
@VerizonSupport still buggy
@VerizonSupport the game starting still no reply 🤦‍♂️
@VerizonSupport Telling me I am not subscribed! Second day on phone with support and still nothing....
@VerizonSupport i just want to talk to someone that isnt a robot about how my computer cant see one of my networks and im just on hold and talking to bots
@VerizonSupport I’m home now.
@VerizonSupport I just did that.
@VerizonSupport I’ll have to let you know tomorrow. I’d test it now, but I have sleeping kids. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport I’m still getting missed call notifications even when I answer the phone.
@VerizonSupport Didn't work.  And yes I also unplugged the box
@VerizonSupport Yes it is.  I took power cord and coaxial cable out of DVR as well.  Still happening.
@VerizonSupport Nope.  Unplugged pwer and coaxial.  Reset it up. Still showing.  Then undid power on one of the boxes.  Still there.
@VerizonSupport I was in a chat session Friday night. Was told engineers need to monitor my signal. Would contact me via social media. Nothing yet. Anything
@VerizonSupport I finally got a live person. But the wait times are crazy long. It wasn’t a troubleshooting problem either. I needed a person.
@VerizonSupport As of this moment i dont have a replacement on the way and im still being charged a surcharge and the original down payment for the device
@VerizonSupport I ordered a phone and the package arrived yesterday but it was empty, i talked to customer service yesterday and they suspended the phone
@VerizonSupport the remote works fine... it just says power on the stb isn’t connected to the tv &amp; i now have to unplug &amp; plug back the box to make it work
@VerizonSupport Yes. It seems like the only fix to make things work... but it’s temporary until i turn off the tv and turn it back on
@VerizonSupport nope. to get that i’ve been unplugging the power and plugging. it just shows on tv stb not on when it is. didn’t before the update.
@VerizonSupport how long am i supposed to wait??? https://t.co/EtjyUWem0F
@VerizonSupport so it stopped and went back to the tv. is this the magic fix?!
@VerizonSupport didn’t fix it... latest update did something to my tv now i have to continue unplugging the box to get it to work https://t.co/Sx93et3gRi
@VerizonSupport just the main one in the living room
@VerizonSupport its a vms100 arris if that means anything... but no i dont know how to cold init it. but what ive been doing is unplugging to get it working
@VerizonSupport It's all scrambled
@VerizonSupport We only have one tv.
@VerizonSupport Yes...
@VerizonSupport Nope still scrambled https://t.co/TqNSdnqVH3
@VerizonSupport Did all these things. Still scrambled. Can you just relaod it on your system. I can't be the only person having the problem with on demand
@VerizonSupport Thanks that worked. Love you guys.
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Keep offering options that don’t work for my unique situation and keep sidestepping actually helpin
@VerizonSupport Here’s the cord I’ll be cutting 🔌
@VerizonSupport By outsourcing and clearly lacking in training/supervisor resourcing, it proves it is your intention. You haven’t even offered to help lmao
@VerizonSupport Lmao you are still not offering to help. The right answer is: let me get your number and we will call you directly to work this out.
@VerizonSupport Stop assuming I’m stupid, you continue to act like I don’t know what I’m doing and making yourselves look stupid.
@VerizonSupport I’ll just continue to be an unhappy customer and tell everyone I know to cut cords.....since you still have only offered to “look into it” 😂
@VerizonSupport Hey @116136 good to know that other companies are now on your level of terrible customer service, at least the market is consistent now lol
@VerizonSupport yep, two rooms over from the router but with a clear line of sight.
@VerizonSupport my laptop doesn't have an ethernet port
@VerizonSupport no, I have 1 computer. Also, why does your speed test totally and absolutely contradict google's? By a huge, huge margin?
@VerizonSupport Internet is down. Only service i have. I tried restarting router. No fix.
@VerizonSupport Nope. I’ll try that.
@VerizonSupport Reset. Still no internet. I tried calling and your customer service number keeps hanging up on me.
@VerizonSupport It feels like it takes longer to load pages now
@VerizonSupport I’m talking about my phone https://t.co/8yHE5FPyFT
@VerizonSupport Sprint https://t.co/GHxOFJDFWk
@VerizonSupport You should advertise the truth - 940mb for old AOL guys still buying Dell desktops
@VerizonSupport I have no idea what that is or why as a customer paying for a service need to figure it out - ADD ON another service. Stay wired my friend.
@VerizonSupport No I am exposing you for you crap service you can DM me how to get out of it.
@VerizonSupport Just DM me the rules to cancel and you guys can sit on wired dells from 10 years ago
@VerizonSupport Not to mention I got 42 voice messages and never gave out my number and paid to have it not listed
@VerizonSupport And I had a single login to AppleTV instead of having to literally do over 40 verifications numbers and sites - you guys are the Stone Age.
@VerizonSupport I'd a service visit to fix internet. It goes off and on every 30-40 mins. Online chat reps have not been able to fix it.
@VerizonSupport Atlanta site or Verizon?! Why would I have to watch a show online instead so on my TV?!
@VerizonSupport I am wired, getting anywhere from 33-55 both ways. FWIW I'm normally above 80/80 even during prime hours.
@VerizonSupport 35/55 using your site in Safari. Btw Verizon speedtest does not load in Chrome or Firefox due to a cross-origin request/https issue.
@VerizonSupport Assuming it's part of the ONT, yes.
@VerizonSupport Sure..
@VerizonSupport Hi and thanks! Just The Edge channel. Mrs Doubtfire and Rush Hour 2 are fine.. lol
@VerizonSupport Yes all tvs just the Edge channel though.. strange.. thanks anyway!
@VerizonSupport it's a global issue my man, not confined to any specific site
@VerizonSupport ok, how do I parse the trace? I'm getting a lot of asterixs
@VerizonSupport and so on... https://t.co/eM4VIyalCT
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes when I reset it
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport I do have one
@VerizonSupport DSL
@VerizonSupport You’re welcome and no, I haven’t.
@VerizonSupport I did and there are no outages
@VerizonSupport Yes, I do. Will provide in private message.
@VerizonSupport I would like to finally confirm my order and set an installation date for @115722 service at my home. I’ve spent 5 hours on the phone and online trying to navigate a simple order change with no success. DM me to assist further.
@VerizonSupport I believe so the tax amount is higher than the rate!
@VerizonSupport Give us a better deal then. Hit me with an offer on Twitter right now.
@VerizonSupport Everything is good except video isn't working on the local pole. Any idea how soon that will be resolved? Things had been going so good!
@VerizonSupport It's connected via a CableCard to a TiVo.
@VerizonSupport The tech attempted to, we ran through the guided setup, but then he said video isn't working for the immediate area.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport fios
@VerizonSupport my online account is incorrect and I have been trying to get this fixed for 2 months
@VerizonSupport yes. i need my account scrubbed.
@VerizonSupport Only for residential I believe:(
@VerizonSupport I don't need to toggle I need Fios for business at my address!
@VerizonSupport No @115722 for another year at my address:(
@VerizonSupport We've done everything! Held alarm button for 30-sec, reset modem after 5min, etc. Had tech appt today 8-10am. No one showed! It's 6:40pm.
@VerizonSupport would happily report like, a bunch of website bugs for you guys though because I never don't have problems
@VerizonSupport well he had me reset my router and now my chat with him is gone so...
@VerizonSupport it's every time. this is a problem that should be fixed. I shouldn't have to clear browser cache every time i want to use your site
@VerizonSupport the first is i have to reboot my router literally every day to connect to wifi every morning. i'm talking with my second person in 12 hrs
@VerizonSupport Sadly, I live in an area of NJ that does not offer @115722 . Might want to work on that. #Competition @116136 @15949
@VerizonSupport Everything is taken care of. I would still like a way to contact management... does that not exist within verizon?
@VerizonSupport After cycling, it's connected but I'm bummed about the recent instability. Especially when two Amazon Echos tell me aloud about it 😒
@VerizonSupport Down again, blinking white globe.
@VerizonSupport Cycled router, it connected for a minute but is now blinking white &amp; connection is lost.
@VerizonSupport No changes. It's been fine for almost a year but has randomly lost connection at least once a day for the last few days.
@VerizonSupport Just went down again, acting like it's a reboot? Globe goes: red, blinking white, solid white, then Wi-Fi comes back on.
@VerizonSupport Followed but can't DM. Follow back?
@VerizonSupport Nvm. It's back.
@VerizonSupport We had it for 10 minutes now it's gone.
@VerizonSupport The FAIL light blinked
@VerizonSupport this is just to shop your service as a potential new customer
@VerizonSupport Was told NO set up fee, tech said $225 fee. C svc said that we should have been told about the install fee, but nothing they cld do.
@VerizonSupport iPad right now
@VerizonSupport just checked phone, appears to be ok. Pls don't make me upgrade to new iOS
@VerizonSupport My internet service disconnects every 5 minutes
@VerizonSupport I resolved the issue, my apologies
@VerizonSupport Not entirely sure to be honest, one of my roommates fixed it.
@VerizonSupport My bad, you were right.  slowest to fastest, tests were 20 ft away (no obstructions) via WiFi, inches away via WiFi, and ethernet https://t.co/hwbv6vsH95
@VerizonSupport Neither. I live on a block of row homes though. I have 5 devices on the network, only 2 active right now. all are using 5G i think
@VerizonSupport you mean via ethernet?  that's what the 3rd pic in the series above is.  I got 57 megabits per second down.  sorry if i'm misunderstanding
@VerizonSupport here are the results.  one WiFi from 20 ft away, one wired.  (the faster one is the wired test) https://t.co/64dueAX1Uz
@VerizonSupport the 50/50, internet only
@VerizonSupport It was over WiFi, but I don't think it matters when it's this slow. https://t.co/DR5dSvxh2R
@VerizonSupport The current update for Samsung s7/s7 edge. It's a software update
@VerizonSupport @115990 Sorry, didn't read the account bio.  Yes please! .@115990
@VerizonSupport That was a waste of time. You answer like @116136 &amp; I hate #comcast
@VerizonSupport The link doesn’t work
@VerizonSupport It just asks me to confirm my address. I do that &amp; nothing happens
@VerizonSupport Internet explorer 8 &amp; Apple’s latest system
@VerizonSupport I stupidly chose to buy a product over renting &amp; was not able to come to a resolution w/customer service. I am told nothing that can be done
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Both, honestly, but the home line is more obnoxious.
@VerizonSupport i logged in and this isnt an option
@VerizonSupport my plan, blocks, manage plan, etc
@VerizonSupport Mobile , 23225
@VerizonSupport We think that it's a Verizon phone line. Our power company confirmed it's not their power line.
@VerizonSupport Thanks, wish I could upgrade to gigabit some time lol
@VerizonSupport Verizon Fios
@VerizonSupport Phone internet tv. out of work and loosing revenue. 24 hours is unacceptable Was told it’s being worked on but no one is at the fiber break.
@VerizonSupport Thank you, you’ve been as much help as used tampon
@VerizonSupport No I was told it was being worked on. I’m at the site, no one here. Been 3 hours so far. Zip is 10547.
@VerizonSupport Oh look! Another wet tampon working at verizon
@VerizonSupport @185054 This doesn't work. I sign in and it just tries to sell me a phone.
@VerizonSupport No I called and the robot said there’s an outage in the area
@VerizonSupport THANK YOU that worked
@VerizonSupport I'm getting some weird message that you don't supply Fios in my building, but do in my area. I think it might be a mistake. Can you help?
@VerizonSupport yep. won't let me even click no annual contract.
@VerizonSupport did already.
@VerizonSupport NYMH02JTTN
@VerizonSupport @197038 Verizon can’t help you. They’re useless
@VerizonSupport Yes. And spoke online with someone. Only speaking directly will give good offers, apparently, but I can’t call during that office’s hours.
@VerizonSupport “Thomas” told me I have to call. One option online, and it is no good.
@VerizonSupport no
@VerizonSupport it went up 21.00 on verizons end
@VerizonSupport no Im looking on https://t.co/wDGAX4bd1I
@VerizonSupport its supposed to be 119.00 not 162
@VerizonSupport There are no laptops in the house.
@VerizonSupport So in my house we have the Verizon modem/router in the kitchen, which is too far for my Mac.  So years ago we installed a&gt;
@VerizonSupport And the Wifi Wizard is only accepting the modem/router, so I don’t think it’s gonna help.
@VerizonSupport My computer isn’t near the router/modem, so i can't do a wired test.
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport Yes...i am getting unwanted ads on my screen when it times out. I have to dismiss it than sign in to my screen
@VerizonSupport @115990 Thank you
@VerizonSupport @126792 Great news! 3 months to resolve your issue yay!
@VerizonSupport yeah, bc i've had this issue on old box before. but i have it currently even tho it said some things might not work
@VerizonSupport Ready to cancel the service at this point
@VerizonSupport Are you serious now? Did you read my responses?
@VerizonSupport Isn't active and package is wrong
@VerizonSupport This is really bad and frustrating. The team acknowledged the issue but no have to go all over again
@VerizonSupport Transferred our numbers to new provider. They should have activated the cancellation. TY.
@VerizonSupport Yes, there is power
@VerizonSupport The blue button ? https://t.co/2TV89CVLgi
@VerizonSupport No change
@VerizonSupport We only have your internet service. DNS server unavailable
@VerizonSupport I do, it’s in my garage. Would rebooting solve it?
@VerizonSupport Or rather, what would initializing the data port do
@VerizonSupport Still no internet
@VerizonSupport I spoke hastily, my internet has returned
@VerizonSupport It’s a condo
@VerizonSupport Then they leave me voicemail that the tech didn’t know how to get on to the phone room... hello I have you detailed instructions c’mon
@VerizonSupport You mean the same jackasses who claim there isn't a problem, and close the ticket when I warn them not to till *I* SAY the problem is fixed?
@VerizonSupport Fixed Monday Night Football on the mobile app yet? Of course you haven't. Fuckfaces. You just wanna punt it to another team.
@VerizonSupport YOUR mobile app. Don't try to blame somebody else, you guys own this piece of crap.
@VerizonSupport yep, as always. ONLY Monday Night Football HAS EVER PRODUCED THIS ERROR AND IT HAS DONE IT FOR FOUR YEARS ON MOST DEVICES.
@VerizonSupport "PowerfulAnswers."

Yeah, right. 

My ass has PowerfulFarts.
@VerizonSupport Four years of trying to deal with those assholes is enough.  In revenue terms, that's almost SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS of Verizon TV &amp; FIOS.
@VerizonSupport Well I thought it would be a smart decision to be a new customer and switch to Verizon but, wireless
@VerizonSupport @115990 If you want, I hopefully got my order cancelled and am getting my money back after 2 days on the phone and a 2 hour drive to a corporate..
@VerizonSupport Search is currently unavailable. Please try again later.  After clicking troubleshoot, in home agent detected no issues.
@VerizonSupport Will try that and provide an update.
@VerizonSupport All is well, rebooted both and search restored.
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Residential. Fios TV and internet both out
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport Single green light
@VerizonSupport No luck. Solid red Internet light still on g1100  modem/router
@VerizonSupport Still did the same thing I think it's your site it's been happening to others
@VerizonSupport Did that it's still doing the same
@VerizonSupport I'll try that
@VerizonSupport It's doing it on other devices as well
@VerizonSupport It fails at 95%
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Cellular. I had service when I fell asleep last night and I woke up today with no service. Restarted phone numerous times.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport When I replaced the battery TV, Internet, Phone worked until the battery ran low. I just bought the battery today. I'm a network engineer and I'm very knowledgeable about technology. I need the BBU replaced. Status light is blinking green indicating a fault.
@VerizonSupport Power is fine 120v. I measured it with a volt meter. The lights on the ONT are blinking also. Its the BBU.
@VerizonSupport Yes, TV, Phone, and Internet are all down.
@VerizonSupport System Status Blinking and Battery Red.
@VerizonSupport You are throttling my speeds from 150/150 to 40/40. Should probably not do that since it's illegal 😘
@VerizonSupport Yes. 40/40. Hence how I got the speeds.
@VerizonSupport Already did. Same result
@VerizonSupport Yes. Now stop throttling.
@VerizonSupport Hard wired.
@VerizonSupport WOW! Now my speeds are even slower at 24/40. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport How do I go about canceling service with @115725? Tired of doing this every month. @115900 is offering gig speeds for $10 more.
@VerizonSupport What were you issuing in May 2013?
@VerizonSupport Yes, so I’m asking, should I️ have to switch providers to obtain up-to-date equipment?
@VerizonSupport Apologies, but you still haven't answered as to when a customer can expect new equipment--5 years? When? #FIOS
@VerizonSupport So, if I'm a customer for 10 years, you're not going to upgrade my equipment, ever? What qualifies as signing up for "new service?" #FIOS
@VerizonSupport Does that mean ALL equipment, or cable boxes? Not replacing tech for customers who opt to stay with you seems wrong #FIOS
@VerizonSupport What is the router you currently provide to new customers? Does it support 802.11ac?
@VerizonSupport Yes, although we pay for faster (intermediate) wifi, the system can't support smart TV playback (amazon prime netflix, etc.)
@VerizonSupport We’ve been told they dug up something downtown. That and our little copper wire that needs an upgrade to fiber before we decamp to Cox.
@VerizonSupport need a box because it wont fit in my tv setup at the moment.
@VerizonSupport I guess it’s still not working. I was told to wait from the cable team to contact me
@VerizonSupport I’m trying to figure out how my bill is 125.11 if I haven’t had service since September 3. Each call center rep gives me a different amount.
@VerizonSupport 2. I have unlimited data and my hotspot has worked perfect until the recent "upgrade" which now limits my access after 15gb.
@VerizonSupport Thanks. Just trying to get an update on an order/repair #. Was supposed to get a call by last Saturday. Can I DM the ticket # ?
@VerizonSupport Called on Monday, Oct 02 and got on the repair calendar for Saturday, Oct 7 (yesterday). No call, no show, no FiOS. Still need repair.
@VerizonSupport No, all the lights are green and I can't access the internet, this keeps happening at least once a day
@VerizonSupport This one https://t.co/aRcrfoc7Ro
@VerizonSupport I have done this before and it's doesnt resolve the issue
@VerizonSupport I am connected but I can't access any websites
@VerizonSupport It's green
@VerizonSupport Cellular. It has just been abnormally slow the past couple of days.
@VerizonSupport No, I'm almost certain it's you guys throttling us
@VerizonSupport I'd rather you tweet your responses so the public can see how you try to weasel out of this bs
@VerizonSupport Residential internet.
@VerizonSupport Orange, even after a few restarts guided by robot on the phone. PS, hold time for a person now over 1 hour, 20 minutes.
@VerizonSupport Done, but didn’t seem to help. https://t.co/rmIwkgQJqB
@VerizonSupport It's Orange and I've already reset my router
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I've done that before.
@VerizonSupport I haven't tried watching TV and TV and wifi are the only Verizon services we have. The internet goes on and off.
@VerizonSupport We restarted the router and it seems to be working again. Thanks anyways!
@VerizonSupport That did not work and the Room where the tv is a actually says this box not authorized for DVR???  I've always had it and pay for it
@VerizonSupport Yes every month for many years
@VerizonSupport Will have to do that later. Just left home for a meeting
@VerizonSupport Done but still the same issue
@VerizonSupport It is whenever I select DVR on the pull down menu
@VerizonSupport Only started doing this on Tuesday
@VerizonSupport FIX IT!!  ; ) actually someone fr verizon is coming to look at it (?) on wednesday.
@VerizonSupport I jokingly ask is Time Warner interfering I just don’t know what to say
@VerizonSupport I am hooked up completely connected and consistently 52 drops it is so frustrating I’ve called in on this problem over and over
@VerizonSupport Thank you
@VerizonSupport I have 5G!  Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport Yes. PC w/ WMC + Cable Card.  Connected to TV.
@VerizonSupport every channel is choppy, it's barely raining
@VerizonSupport yes
@VerizonSupport Yes I replied via tweet with a photo and a note that it didn’t fix anything.
@VerizonSupport Yeah, power seems good. 👍 https://t.co/85PChobe8i
@VerizonSupport Like my cable and phone? I don't know I wasn't using either of those when it happened
@VerizonSupport I checked on my phone, pc, and tablet and they were all out if that's what you meant before
@VerizonSupport Circuit breaker tripped, now we can't get the internet or tv working. We flipped it back on but we need to reboot everything.
@VerizonSupport Only tested fx and spike but so far yes
@VerizonSupport Nope, but it seems to have stopped for now thxs
@VerizonSupport Yup
@VerizonSupport Consistent video and connection issues. Smart TV disconnects, AppleTV can't connect. VOIP cuts in and out.
@VerizonSupport I don't see that in the app.
@VerizonSupport Right now 2.4... but I've tried both
@VerizonSupport I don't see anything that says WiFi Analyzer.
@VerizonSupport download 948.26 upload 888.94
@VerizonSupport Didn't help. Still buffering or not connecting at all.
@VerizonSupport Didn't help much. Intermittent pixelation and buffering. Still can't connect to half my services.
@VerizonSupport Yes no problem with channel 835
@VerizonSupport The NFL APP
@VerizonSupport No but I'm using the fios app now. Awesome. Thanks for the help and tip. Fios app 1 NFL app 0
@VerizonSupport doesn’t seem to be working. https://t.co/PPkCRbvfOh
@VerizonSupport Red light on the wifi symbol and the television is working fine
@VerizonSupport YES
@VerizonSupport Both are white at the moment but wifi is not working
@VerizonSupport It says it's connected but Anything that requires internet will not load
@VerizonSupport A recording of CBS Sunday Morning
@VerizonSupport version 5.9
@VerizonSupport yes, both version 5.9
@VerizonSupport I deleted the app and downloaded it again. I logged back in. Got an error message, video started choppy.  Then stopped.
@VerizonSupport I do it ever week, I reboot, I try it all.  I shouldn't have to try and of this shit.
@VerizonSupport New York
@VerizonSupport Both. The building has 4 units: 1F, 1R, 2F, and 2R. 

Your site lists: 2f Flr 2, Flr 1, Flr 1F, Flr 2, and Flr bsm.
@VerizonSupport Did that during the 1/2 and it’s still slow. Two TVs in house and the one with set top box is slow/behind real time. Other one is right
@VerizonSupport what does that even mean???? and can't do anything during the game which is running delayed #verizonfiofail
@VerizonSupport Hi, I guess I gave up before you replied.  Time's tight.
@VerizonSupport Should be 150/150 
I'm at 58/59 with one phone and a PlayStation running on it
@VerizonSupport Negative
@VerizonSupport Correct havent changed anything from when i first connected it
@VerizonSupport 2 phones both just being on not doing anything that should be eating up the service
@VerizonSupport home internet is what the issue is about sorry if i confused you
@VerizonSupport My ping is 12 now and my upload seems better. Never tried that method b4, thanks
@VerizonSupport My dvr is still mostly useless at this point. What should I do?
@VerizonSupport It’s been stuck here for 5m. Is something supposed to happen? https://t.co/Cupy0mI2Wd
@VerizonSupport Yep. Full power cycle.
@VerizonSupport Same problem with different remote on this STB. On all other STBs, there is a 20s seat when accessing the main dvr.
@VerizonSupport I’ve noticed it on other units in my house. I didn’t try to app.
@VerizonSupport Yes, just the $10/month local channels with no cable box as advertised on our bill.
@VerizonSupport .@VerizonSupport no dial tone
@VerizonSupport No. There's only 1 phone plugged in.
@VerizonSupport No landline service
@VerizonSupport I would respond if I had the effective LTE coverage that I once had. 🤔🤷🏻‍♀️ But I don’t.. so it’ll take me about an hour to get back to you.
@VerizonSupport So no internet for 2 days while the programmers are trying to figure it out is frustrating.
@VerizonSupport Yes they did. Want it?
@VerizonSupport No tech visit. But the programmers on your end are working on it. The prob is that I work from home.
@VerizonSupport Didn’t work. Tried that plus new certified HDMI premium cable.  Might need STB replaced.
@VerizonSupport It’s the only STB we have. VMS1100. Other devices sync fine with the TV (Sony XBR 850D). Blu-ray player and PC work fine.  Odd indeed.
@VerizonSupport It’s more with the app connected to the service. We haven’t been able to use it for months, and anytime I try to get help, nothing changes.
@VerizonSupport not helpful - no map just an FAQ we need OUR modem tested for connection no weekend support to call?!!
@VerizonSupport Business account and support # only M-F!?!?!
@VerizonSupport How do you reboot the box?  Just unplugging it?
@VerizonSupport I already spent my time researching to answer my question when your sales couldn’t explain that I’d need a second box to record 12 shows
@VerizonSupport No - lights appear as normal when it happens.
@VerizonSupport Sorry for the delayed response. We have had to reset it but it typically restores itself.
@VerizonSupport I don’t believe so. Will try this in the morning and let you know.
@VerizonSupport We are having continual lapses in our internet service. In all rooms, even the ones closest to the modem/router.
@VerizonSupport Yup. This is not a TV or box related item. It appears to be what is being sent out in MSG2 and MSG2+. What is up? Please check your end
@VerizonSupport idk what this is and im too lazy to try it right now but thank you fem ill hit that up later and see whats good
@VerizonSupport VERIZON LIED ABOUT  ARRIVAL TIME AGAIN.  ANOTHER NO SHOW!
@VerizonSupport DMed you and GOT NO ANSWER.  WILL NOT SET UP ANOTHER APPOINTMENT WITHOUT AN EXACT TIME.  TWO DAYS OF NO SHOWS.
@VerizonSupport @115725 great job.  You blew off an installation on Tuesday and apparently another today!!d
@VerizonSupport I have cellular service. Everyone here in town is complaining about how slow it is. I can't even look up anything on the internet.
@VerizonSupport I am still trying to find a way to get ahold of Verizon ...
@VerizonSupport Would be nice if I could talk with Verizon on the phone to get some help getting my internet back up
@VerizonSupport It then ends the phone call.
@VerizonSupport Yes it is all connected
@VerizonSupport And I called again, told me to call back during normal business hours.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Don't worry about it, spectrum said they can match everything st almost half the price
@VerizonSupport No.  I don't.  It was working fine and suddenly went out
@VerizonSupport Done
@VerizonSupport No change
@VerizonSupport Is there a problem with that?  I know where that is.
@VerizonSupport Just cable.  Everything else is fine.  Both boxes are not working.
@VerizonSupport That didn't solve it.
@VerizonSupport Yes, again. I only see the pixelation on FS1.
@VerizonSupport Yes it's happening on all my TVs.
@VerizonSupport No they did not. They kept moving the date further and further back each time they mentioned it. My call dropped while being transferred.
@VerizonSupport I have no internet and they can’t get someone out here for a week. After putting me on hold for 2.5 hours. Then hung up on me
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport Rebooted &amp; it worked! Thank you! #ItsLit! https://t.co/LdoCLeXFQE
@VerizonSupport I do. Not sure what is going on. They shouldn't be left just hanging loose.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport One of three TVs
@VerizonSupport Yes, the coax was removed and checked. The cord looks fine, I also tightened it and I’m still receiving the same issue. These were also instructions technical support online gave me, and also the instructions from the box. Still no to avail.
@VerizonSupport I just swapped the two boxes and the problem seems to stay with location not the box.
@VerizonSupport No I’m unable to switch the coax cables
@VerizonSupport Yes I am
@VerizonSupport IDK. I don't have a phone to check it. It was working fine until 8:50 pm. DSL went out. Switched to Verizon phone, then that went out.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Still no good. That doesn't explain cell phone either.I spend 280 a month between dsl &amp; cell. Not happy.
@VerizonSupport @115990 I can't do this now. If it's still down tomorrow I'll try again. Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Just fios internet
@VerizonSupport It's been on and off all day but now it's been off for awhile
@VerizonSupport Error code: HBA_-1
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport I love the error message when submitting a ticket, "You have entered an invalid key at line number 1 and character number 80".
@VerizonSupport Great...now that you had me remove the app, it says I need to upgrade to FiOS Quantum.  I already did that with the new DVR...now what?
@VerizonSupport Yes, but since the removal of the app, now it says I am not a FiOS Quantum subscriber.
@VerizonSupport Unable to find any set-top box.  It was working before I removed the app.  Now it doesn't work.
@VerizonSupport I paid a lot of money to upgrade...now developers have to fix this?  This doesn't sound like it's getting fixed if Tier 1 can't fix it.
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the great service of "fiber optic...better option" wifi. https://t.co/Y9NFrFrQRC
@VerizonSupport AMAZING! https://t.co/JYC96PMwfD
@VerizonSupport both
@VerizonSupport I was told when purchasing that the router that I buy would give range from hour to back yard whys it not doing that. Second
@VerizonSupport Trying to authorize NBC via Roku but there error is on Verizon site using my credentials
@VerizonSupport Yes error is after login..seems like an issue with your site
@VerizonSupport It's just Verizon we don't have Verizon FiOS.

Been trying to watch TV &amp; Netflix but every 3 minutes it freezes &amp; I get that spinning wheel.
@VerizonSupport Yes. DSL but only use for WIFI. We don't use the landline at all. Extremely slow speeds. Do I have to pay more for bandwidth?
@VerizonSupport Yes. Been through that Multiple times since beginning of this year &amp; still no success. Ive spoken to countless @VerizonSupport folks. Help??
@VerizonSupport Yes it's a wireless connection &amp; I've been having problems for about 10 months now. Sporadic but tonight it's horrible. https://t.co/YASGy0LheO
@VerizonSupport Everything is Wireless. Problem I have is every 5 min my TV freezes up. Do I have to pay @115725 more money per month to fix this problem? https://t.co/5tCSWTcPEH
@VerizonSupport I tried a reboot, but this seems to be affecting more than just me.  Is there a big set top box that controls everyones that you can reboot?
@VerizonSupport I only have one STB, it's also not letting me login online
@VerizonSupport Had updated &amp; still had problem. Delete &amp; reinstall worked. Thank you. (New OS on DVR is still super sloooooowwwww.)
@VerizonSupport On Demand menu navigation on model CHS 435HDC is super slow after last major UI upgrade.
@VerizonSupport Just spent 40 minutes on phone w/ tech agent who was utterly unable to help. Looks like the game just ended, so we missed the last 3 innings
@VerizonSupport None of the devices I have are connecting to HBOGo, it's telling me I'm not a subscriber, I am. Looks like others are having the same issue
@VerizonSupport For that matter, Starz isn't working either. This time when I verify my Verizon creds on https://t.co/0BRoKuBhdb it tells me I need FIOS
@VerizonSupport Yes, just not on Xbox or HBO mobile app. It says this message after I log in using my account info
@VerizonSupport Please help me too.
@VerizonSupport Gone round with the tech people and the billing people. I have no picture and cant get on thru Apple TV either.
@VerizonSupport Settop box is out. Can’t login to watch on Apple TV. Fios says I need TV service, which I have. Pretty much done with you guys.
@VerizonSupport Nope. The whole site is like twitching.
@VerizonSupport The app won’t allow me to log in
@VerizonSupport (Sigh) Thanks for letting me know
@VerizonSupport red
@VerizonSupport it's working now, thank you, great customer service, 10/10, would recommend
@VerizonSupport ....what about @196474 ??
@VerizonSupport I need technical support and couldn't wait any longer tonight.  I will have to try again later.  What is the best option?
@VerizonSupport 952
@VerizonSupport Rent it. https://t.co/2MVGlg5cQO
@VerizonSupport Cable box. Like nonstop last few days. Super annoying and horrible timing!
@VerizonSupport We’re sad we missed the ending of a movie we were watching. It’s not on demand and it was so close to over. Reboot #4 sucked bad!
@VerizonSupport Red internet light and wi-fi light. Multiple neighbors complaining of the same thing. Still out, still fed up.
@VerizonSupport @205851 My phone is slow I'm getting a new one and its not Verizon
@VerizonSupport Both lights are on. https://t.co/h9SczT1tXg
@VerizonSupport Just did the reset with the pen. Both lights came back on as they were before
@VerizonSupport The internet connection is working again after the reset. Thank you for your help
@VerizonSupport We have someone here now trying again
@VerizonSupport Wireless phone service
@VerizonSupport Snails pace https://t.co/HoLszLSxE9
@VerizonSupport That’s not my problem. EVERYONE is having issues without internet. Your service is lagging and buffering.
@VerizonSupport Let me elaborate again...The connection without WiFi lags and buffers. People are waiting 10-20 minutes on a webpage to load. Times out
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport Well.... installer fell and busted water pipe.   Water everywhere.   Now no water running. https://t.co/XXoHVoOLZM
@VerizonSupport Supervisor Ms. Williams said she will not help me and I cannot contact her again or use her as a reference in solving the issue.
@VerizonSupport You must follow or edit your settings so I can DM you
@VerizonSupport Wireless. I turned if off and on and it's now working.
@VerizonSupport hi! i got someone…surprisingly faster than the robot lady said. which is good news
@VerizonSupport Aside from having a broken tablet I'm still paying for, I'm dealing with a snarky, confused CS rep who seems to be way in over his head.
@VerizonSupport Ah. He also says I don't know how hard he worked to check on my account and that he can move mountains for me. 😐
@VerizonSupport Wireless. Your CS Jesse has just informed me he wants me to 'feel his sincerity'. What?
@VerizonSupport Yes. Works w Watch ESPN.
@VerizonSupport Works w ESPN just fine within seconds of this failed attempt https://t.co/MMg9FS6q1r
@VerizonSupport Hey...2 stb and modem $171
@VerizonSupport Acct # 851-609-541-0001-29
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Reset it. Still no change
@VerizonSupport Yes...TV, security system is affected. And yes, I do know where the battery backup unit is located
@VerizonSupport It worked! Thank you!
@VerizonSupport I have all equipment that was installed in my home- cable boxes, router, etc. Was told to leave the outside box and take everything else.
@VerizonSupport cellular
@VerizonSupport Unfortunately, yes
@VerizonSupport I just spent almost 2 hrs on the phone with customer service. Unless you can get someone here today when my original appt was scheduled
@VerizonSupport No thanks! Too late. You guys messed up. Someone on your end cancelled my appt. I have no time for this bs
@VerizonSupport nah...just paying for starz...not used to such a high bill. 😨
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/iupu1Jzd0u
@VerizonSupport Still red globe on my router
@VerizonSupport I did.
@VerizonSupport Reset? No. I reboot it. Why would I reset and lose all my settings?
@VerizonSupport I’m waiting for a rep
@VerizonSupport I’m unable to connect to the internet. Did all the troubleshooting steps in the app. Rebooted router. Now red globe.
@VerizonSupport @208808 Hey @115722 is there an outage in Zip Code 22153?
@VerizonSupport Your overpriced and overrated service plans.
@VerizonSupport Jesus fuck. All I am saying is that you generally suck. Too expensive for the service you get. Cell service and customer service.
@VerizonSupport Would rather take my five lines and move on
@VerizonSupport Made a purchase and it was undeliverable. Hoping to reroute it to a work address or pick it up at the UPS facility
@VerizonSupport It is for a smartwatch.
@VerizonSupport Yes. We reset our brand new router regularly. Also the set box. I watch movies on Apple TV instead of FIOS because there's always a problem
@VerizonSupport Well how come they did not honor that? Or tell me about it? Can you provide more info ?
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport By phone thy said package is 104.99. Plus that internet upgrade fee. Can I set it up from another computer and get it??
@VerizonSupport Which prevents me from using my bank account with VZ. I am beyond frustrated as this issue was created by a double charge from Verizon!
@VerizonSupport I was charged twice by VZ on 8/31 &amp; 9/1. I contacted my bank to reverse one of the charges. Now VZ has placed my account on some neg list...
@VerizonSupport No I am not
@VerizonSupport Ok got it.
@VerizonSupport Did it. No changes
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Ok will do
@VerizonSupport Yes, right next to the router
@VerizonSupport I'm wanting to look into getting new home internet service.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/V5NtttqvL7
@VerizonSupport Only if the pricing is the lower amount. I shouldn't pay more simply b/c I'm already a customer!
@VerizonSupport How can we speak to a supervisor not a customer service rep.
@VerizonSupport No we are trying to stream a soccer game. We’ve stopped trying. We’re moving in a few weeks.  This doesn’t help keeping Fios internet after.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/HQmqI0QcfN
@VerizonSupport Either way we all use WiFi in the house I don’t have anything here to run it hardwired
@VerizonSupport 2.4
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/WLACM663Hk
@VerizonSupport No message. None of my subscribed channels work
@VerizonSupport The fios stb in my master bedroom is not generating a picture. And I can not get through to a representative
@VerizonSupport Cell Phone still works, but Fios is not connecting. Red light on router.
@VerizonSupport I reset it and it works now. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport I don't have it nor can I login to get it
@VerizonSupport what could you use?
@VerizonSupport wireless, a replacement device
@VerizonSupport Some reason my cell number is calling people. Even tho i didn't call them.
@VerizonSupport Will a frontier quantum gateway ac1750 work or does it have to specifically say Verizon?
@VerizonSupport Just internet
@VerizonSupport Okay thanks
@VerizonSupport @211194 Yes it is in Virginia
@VerizonSupport basic things like hiding channels you dont subscribe to, when flipping between channels. It's not a great UI compared to X1
@VerizonSupport Wirelessly and no
@VerizonSupport I don’t sadly
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/FPDNN3nVDU
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/Ysx84CkwC5
@VerizonSupport It just made things worse lol
@VerizonSupport Yea I’ve been off FaceTime for a while now. It’s honestly been bad for a month but it’s just unbearable now
@VerizonSupport Like sometimes I’ll get 2 bars of WiFi when I’m literally in the same room as the router
@VerizonSupport I have no idea what that means lol
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Yea 1 sec
@VerizonSupport Never mind I don’t even have enough internet to load the page. And I’m in the same room as the router
@VerizonSupport It’s at this right now and it sat for 5mins. The upload failed to get over .50 https://t.co/94HllnD4qT
@VerizonSupport Well I’ve been trying to update a game on Xbox and it’s been 30mins and it’s only on 14% while it take under 5mins for my friends
@VerizonSupport Already did, installation tomorrow 🤘🏾
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport 100 Mbps UP and 120 Mbps Down
@VerizonSupport The 150 up and down with Fios TV home phone and cell phone
@VerizonSupport Yes the globe is red
@VerizonSupport Yes has a green light
@VerizonSupport We’ve changed the password if that’s a custom change
@VerizonSupport Yes it’s in our garage. Should I still factory reset?
@VerizonSupport That worked
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes everything is now working
@VerizonSupport Service is dead not TV not internet plus you guys changed the pricing on me to 60$ more a month would really love to stay the same price e
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/exHjxvk5wO
@VerizonSupport Where there is none https://t.co/Oa3mveAE0N
@VerizonSupport Still have this in the screen after hard resetting it and now pressing the reset button like you asked https://t.co/4KzB8ClLjT
@VerizonSupport Yes I do
@VerizonSupport Now being told we have to wait until tomorrow AM for @19128 new location. Still w/o now.
@VerizonSupport You guys were supposed to install internet &amp; phones on Sat. Only did internet. All day could not have ticket reissued for service.
@VerizonSupport ‘Upgraded’ equipment crashes constantly. Service calls didn’t help. Total waste. Technician coming tomorrow.
@VerizonSupport I’m not getting any tv shows from my tv to cable in the wall and would like a tech to come look at it. Just hung up after 30minutes on hold
@VerizonSupport Placed an order 10/1. The conf showed a diff price. Called. Told there's nothing they can do. Was asked to fax screenshots. No response.
@VerizonSupport Yes. You'll see arrows at the $2 for multi room enhanced dvr for 2 years. The  conf instead shows free until aug 2018. Can I DM the image?
@VerizonSupport Actually I can't dm. Here the offer I clicked on. https://t.co/EhO8jpl0hg
@VerizonSupport Please send me a number to call so someone can fix this bait &amp; switch. I've been on hold for over an hour. A direct line would be wonderful.
@VerizonSupport Interesting for a phone company 😉I'm dm' if you now.
@VerizonSupport blocked, the voicemail icon appears when device never rang every 90 minutes or so
@VerizonSupport Not working down TV and internet. Can you get someone that can help cause no one has in almost 2 hours this is ridiculously frustrating https://t.co/Y2U0D8Xeyk
@VerizonSupport I have no dial tone. Need a tech. Phone goes out eveytime it rains.
@VerizonSupport Uninstalled again, powered down, powered up, redownloaded, and now seems to b working. Thx
@VerizonSupport It's fine, I got off the phone with the techs and they finally gave me a credible answer
@VerizonSupport I really just want a number where I can talk with someone who knows how networks work
@VerizonSupport Yes I have tried everything and nothing has worked. I’ve gone through all the steps and it’s still out. Fios TV is out too
@VerizonSupport Yes it’s flashing red on “Fail” and solid red on “Video” I’ve already unplugged and reset and it didn’t work
@VerizonSupport Yes they did
@VerizonSupport Because all the history should have been recorded on your imaginary “this shall be recorded for quality assurance purposes” mailbox
@VerizonSupport Porting of my 20yr old phone number. For the 25th time in the past 30days.
@VerizonSupport Any progress while your customers are inconvenienced?  We want our channels back!!  @207389 @212914 @212915
@VerizonSupport is that where it all comes into the house?
@VerizonSupport i see it
@VerizonSupport the devices still aren't working. Is there something else to try?
@VerizonSupport yes--all green lights
@VerizonSupport also we've been having issues with connecting to On Demand (no service), not sure if they are related
@VerizonSupport I do. It's the G1100 model. I've rebooted it sevl times, plugged &amp; unplugged...
@VerizonSupport was on the phone and the verizon store yesterday for about 7 hours.
@VerizonSupport it was cellular
@VerizonSupport I wanted to move my service down the hallway. I asked if they could also move the ONT line to ethernet because I don't have a quantum router
@VerizonSupport Tells me I’m not subscribed. But I am. Chat Support says I can’t watch playoff games. Playoffs don’t start for 7 months.
@VerizonSupport Not an error. It tells me I’m not subscribed. But I am. Online portal and phone support confirmed. https://t.co/frnpWMoSYU
@VerizonSupport Yes. But I’ve already ordered it. It’s already on my account. It’s an auto-renew from last season.
@VerizonSupport I was told I was getting a new phone sent to me. That was a broken promise and a lie.
@VerizonSupport Video on demand
@VerizonSupport A tech was able to tell me it wasn't responding, so I have some work to do tomorrow to see if it's just unplugged so it won't be a week
@VerizonSupport Both light are green
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I can use the internet now
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Reset my password. All set now. Thanks
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes I checked that too
@VerizonSupport Yes I do
@VerizonSupport Sound cuts out too
@VerizonSupport NBC, ABC are problems for past few weeks. Checked the aux cables and tightened https://t.co/yWri1rIVBg
@VerizonSupport Same result every week. When watching game on @115722 mobile app everything is fine. But on https://t.co/p69hQ1f7jE on mac buffering.
@VerizonSupport ...which proves @115722 is purposely buffering the web streaming on mac. So thanks @115722 good job👎🏼
@VerizonSupport Not tonight
@VerizonSupport Trying to DM you, but getting a message that says I cannot send direct messages to this account. Can you DM me to discuss this issue?
@VerizonSupport just the iPad
@VerizonSupport your internet service is god awful. Can’t wait for my new provider. Gave you enough chances.
@VerizonSupport Yes, again tonight, just like every other night. It’s amazing how many phone calls I’ve made and always have issues. Great service 👎🏼
@VerizonSupport Yes, the router even goes red and you have replaced the router so it’s just the service u provide
@VerizonSupport 2/2 it’s ur issue as a provider. Hence why I have taken to social media to prevent others from using ur services
@VerizonSupport Fios quantum... allegedly
@VerizonSupport Wifi via a Verizon router
@VerizonSupport The internet stopped working completely multiples times over the course of a few months
@VerizonSupport Thanks for the response - our internet suddenly get very slow recently. We've been on hold for over 2.5 hours...
@VerizonSupport No. All it says is, "This program is required to be blacked out in your local market on this channel"
@VerizonSupport You know what is in my control? My money. $180 for games I can't even watch? NOPE.
@VerizonSupport It's not on a local channel. I live in Massachusetts. I do not have any local channels from Edmonton on my cable package.
@VerizonSupport @213653 There was a game that aired at 1pm on Center Ice that was blacked out for us, then games later shown on that channel were blacked out too
@VerizonSupport Awesome. Appreciate the help!
@VerizonSupport Yep
@VerizonSupport All lit. Top light is red
@VerizonSupport Didn’t work as usual.
@VerizonSupport I can now.
@VerizonSupport Back up!
@VerizonSupport No it just says it should be restored by 3:04pm.  But that's what it said last time and it was never restored
@VerizonSupport Still nothing
@VerizonSupport Every other channel is working fine
@VerizonSupport Still doesnt work
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport No. Just frozen or black screen
@VerizonSupport It was not working last night. Last time I watched it was Wednesday night. Also trouble with 551, 552 and starz channels
@VerizonSupport Tried it but no change
@VerizonSupport Yes. https://t.co/o20qqy837s
@VerizonSupport It seems to have gotten better now. We couldn’t figure it out. Tried restarting the router several times but the quality was terrible.
@VerizonSupport Yes, not having the same issues
@VerizonSupport You can help by telling me 
-why I was on hold for 40mins with no answer. 
-why I was hung up on
-why my 9:30pm EST callback is 7 mins late.
@VerizonSupport If you’re the social media team, how are you capable of porting phone numbers? Please enlighten me. I’d love to hear this
@VerizonSupport this is part of a computer scam that she was a victim of. These people are calling relentlessly all day@and night.
@VerizonSupport Thank you!
@VerizonSupport No they haven’t but we plan on calling them
@VerizonSupport yes it was
@VerizonSupport Wireless connection https://t.co/ktpgCfflu8
@VerizonSupport No I do not. My cable just shows a black screen
@VerizonSupport My cable isn't working either. Is there an outage in Delaware?
@VerizonSupport Fios is dead. Can’t ping public default gateway.
@VerizonSupport They surely do not
@VerizonSupport @1561 charging $2 an episode to watch shows on demand now even if I’m subscribed to them is what you’re saying?
@VerizonSupport Haven't checked the ONT, but if the 800# has a recording about an outage I don't think it's me. ;) Just curious if its a planned maintenance
@VerizonSupport That's so weird.. 888-553-1555 says there is an outage. Usually your social media team has more details..
@VerizonSupport I assume it's this small black box in my garage
@VerizonSupport I only see one light which is next to "power Ok" and is green
@VerizonSupport No. It's dark
@VerizonSupport @214965 So there is an outing in Delaware?
@VerizonSupport I can't, I'm locked out of my account and the only option I got was US mail for a new password which is insane. Will wait til morning
@VerizonSupport It seems to be good again, I'll let you know if it cuts out again
@VerizonSupport Was going to check, but internet now randomly came back on.  Thanks.
@VerizonSupport It seems to just say video on demand outage.  Does that mean I should have other interruptions?  Reset Ont and still nothing.
@VerizonSupport No problem with TVs... just usual On Demand is down. Not interested in Tweeting text support at 1am. Just fix your recurring system crashes
@VerizonSupport Yes, your service simply fails every few days... not worth 2 hr tech call to reboot my STB/Rtr 9 times to find out its a fios system failure
@VerizonSupport Diagnostics say ethernet is down.  Other users in my surrounding towns are tweeting the same issue.
@VerizonSupport Just the internet...both my rokus are connecting the network and the local network but not the internet
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/3MiJMbwP6k
@VerizonSupport Now the internet light on my router is orange
@VerizonSupport The 4 lights on the main turned off and then turned back on
@VerizonSupport @215878 Wish you'd come to our condo
@VerizonSupport Nope the screen didn’t move.
@VerizonSupport VOD. And yes we have.
@VerizonSupport Yes, also in Edge (3rd browser), but it seems to work if I specifically only open it in my mobile browser. Is the limitation intentional?
@VerizonSupport Trying again today. Can you please help with my original query, or give me a working live-chat link, or tell me how to fix it?
@VerizonSupport Indeed. Told it is a MDU outage - be nice if fixed in time for the @188390 game this evening...
@VerizonSupport Yes and all have come and gone.
@VerizonSupport I was logging into my Verizon residential fios account
@VerizonSupport Yes but not on a desktop only mobile.
@VerizonSupport I have tried it from 3 different browsers and have cleared everything on each and it still pops up.
@VerizonSupport The issue has been replicated on all mobile devices I have tried but not on a desktop or laptop
@VerizonSupport I have and it might have something to do with my slow internet as it does change to a checkmark if I wait about 30 seconds.
@VerizonSupport No it's the best we can get for where we live. 3mbs but I am moving to get 1gps from you guys
@VerizonSupport Will get a different service instead, thanks.
@VerizonSupport It was residential and I spoke with several representatives, no help at all.
@VerizonSupport @217699 The order number was revised 3 times yet kept getting error. CS rep created new order but install is on Monday - 3 wks after initial order
@VerizonSupport i have tried to do a chat and find out what is going on with my bill and no one is available.
@VerizonSupport Installation
@VerizonSupport @217890 step it up VERIZON. my girl has got places to go to make money so she can feed her damn son
@VerizonSupport Thank you for getting back to me.  Still the best customer service in the twitterverse!
@VerizonSupport No. Our wireless service. No service in Healdsburg.
@VerizonSupport Also spent more than 12+ hours on phone with customer service reps with little to no help with all my issues. I think change would be best
@VerizonSupport Hsl. Been promised fios for 2 months by customer service
@VerizonSupport multiple people in my area have been having issues with their phone connecting to LTE it just stays in 3G
@VerizonSupport the chat link does not seem to work can you provide a new one please
@VerizonSupport dm me ill send my number and if you could call that would be the best way
@VerizonSupport I'm having my Fios installed this weekend &amp; was being sent a hotspot in the meantime. Wanted to check on delivery status.
@VerizonSupport Most texts and calls are going to my old iPhone even though I turned off cell data, WiFi, blue tooth etc.
@VerizonSupport I entered my name and phone number then got 3 announcements of large wait times and left. Kindly have someone respond to my email of 28SEP
@VerizonSupport The fact that I cant even make a phone call because i have 1-2 bars is outrageous
@VerizonSupport ...10 all-time dumbest customer service moves I've ever seen. Mind-boggling!
@VerizonSupport great example here of how to do it wrong. I've spent hours talking with a dozen Verizon reps, yet there aren't any notes - so each time I
@VerizonSupport ...was my fave though, when you told me I didn't have Verizon, and to look on my bill to see what phone company I have. That makes the top
@VerizonSupport Verizon Mobile
@VerizonSupport Yes. Went through online support. Earliest available was Friday morning. Had the same problem last week.
@VerizonSupport My residential line is AT&amp;T, our only option here. Just like Verizon is only option for cell service here.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport Yes I did :) Have my PC wired directly to the router with a 50ft Cat5e cable
@VerizonSupport I don't think that's possible atm unfortunately
@VerizonSupport For tech support again for another 30 minutes he was dropped from the line as wa the tech support agent who had JUST connected.
@VerizonSupport Slow service while watching @116602
@VerizonSupport Oh that’s cool you don’t respond to my answer. Might as well been put on hold...
@VerizonSupport Yes the 13th. Understand you’re busy, but if a cancellation comes up...
@VerizonSupport So I’m guessing that was a no? Who can I contact for a refund?
@VerizonSupport I hope so or I’m going to be even more upset than I already am.
@VerizonSupport Yes I was, PADQ0AY5Y1. Believe it’s still open
@VerizonSupport Thank you.
@VerizonSupport That would be for you people to figure out and, it wasn’t all the channels!
@VerizonSupport It isn’t wiring. I work in the audio/video industry &amp; nothing has changed inside. It started acting up the other day. So, ur mess on ur end
@VerizonSupport Yeah, from you all
@VerizonSupport So, do it
@VerizonSupport So, fix whatever you people need to fix on your end! This was the 3rd night in a row having some of the channels breaking up
@VerizonSupport Contact the person who is using my email and tell them to use their own. It’s really not that difficult on your end. Your mistake NOW FIX IT.
@VerizonSupport I'm taking Verizon to court!!!
@VerizonSupport HEY!!! I'M STILL WAITING FOR SOMEBODY ON THE LINE!!!
@VerizonSupport Just WIFI. Tech moved our router but did not fix the issue. Said our router wasn’t strong enough to cover entire house. We have zones with zero signal.
@VerizonSupport Built in 2003. Have never used an extender
@VerizonSupport Lol, already been assisted by Straight Talk Wireless, 10 gigabytes for $45 a month. Of high-speed data. If you can assist that
@VerizonSupport Your support sucks! It really really does.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/VxTpmPW2c0
@VerizonSupport And I’m nowhere near Philadelphia or Boston https://t.co/kUo25bgAcp
@VerizonSupport It’s not. I’m not in either TV market
@VerizonSupport Credit where credit is due- @115725 reached out and resolved the issue.
@VerizonSupport Just followed but unable to DM - of course this didn't work
@VerizonSupport On my iPhone and my Mac.  Tried with FiOS and my cell network.
@VerizonSupport Yes I am able to log in to https://t.co/7LXgZvF2xQ
@VerizonSupport I wiped out my cookies and things are working.  It's very odd.  But I am working correctly now.  I appreciate your trying to help and apologize for wasting your time!
@VerizonSupport The Comedy Central app seems to be affected as well.
@VerizonSupport I noticed it about 25 minutes ago.
@VerizonSupport It happens within the IOS USA application and in safari on my iPhone.  If also happens on Firefox and Safari on my Mac.  I am going to https://t.co/IquwA5nRvB to start the process.
@VerizonSupport I paid extra to go from 50mbs to 100 with no noticeable difference and then u offer 1 Tera bite for the same price I pay for 100 but I can’t get that price because I’ve only been with u for as long as u’ve been available. I pay over 300 a month and I don’t think it’s worth it
@VerizonSupport Tried that multiple times, had 2 different Verizon technicians at my house, trying 3 routers, exchanging equipment in the basement, swapping cables, etc. I’m tired of trying!
@VerizonSupport But why is a Sixers-Celtics game blacked out while I'm nowhere near either area?
@VerizonSupport I did search and NBATV was the only network carrying the game. Is there a way to test if 07081 is in that blackout area? BTW thanks for the quick responses.  Greatly appreciate the customer service!
@VerizonSupport I already have every channel u offer and 100 MB’s that I pay 80 bucks for. Trying to get rid of u
@VerizonSupport Yes it happens to all channels on my primary box only. After rebooting box it fixes until I️ change the channel
@VerizonSupport No answer there either. Is anyone working tonight?
@VerizonSupport OK, I've been helped online. Thanks.
@VerizonSupport Yes the question was answered and a manager with slightly better manners assisted us.
@VerizonSupport This is my phone while I stand in my kitchen 1 bar of WiFi https://t.co/pvrYWrksn1
@VerizonSupport It does not
@VerizonSupport The 5G is pathetic we are very disappointed customers
@VerizonSupport Only the iPhones seem to locate the 5 TiVo and Printer and Kindle don't see it
@VerizonSupport Yep! Just did it now.
@VerizonSupport I’m using Chrome. Should I try Firefox?
@VerizonSupport Firfefox and safari also aren’t working. https://t.co/NHYzdVrLCG site is where it gets stuck. Turned off all of my browser extensions and tried multiple laptops.
@VerizonSupport It’s just USA Network so maybe it’s their redirect?
@VerizonSupport Actually no, isn’t working with ABC Freeform either
@VerizonSupport I haven’t but I can log into my account successfully
@VerizonSupport I am!
@VerizonSupport Yea, I’ll just make sure I’m signed out fully on those!
@VerizonSupport Technically I got a 10x speed increase. I have a 75 “M”bps connection https://t.co/uq4Zn3ihQ1
@VerizonSupport Much better with wired. What are my options ? https://t.co/Z97MQX71oK
@VerizonSupport Did the factory reset the other day and the speed was ok the other day. Today it’s down to ~1mbps again https://t.co/DFe8yKeE2N
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport Wired speed is good. Around 60 mbps. Wireless is very bad.
@VerizonSupport No. No wireless device.
@VerizonSupport It’s on auto. What is the recommended value?
@VerizonSupport no, only an Xbox
@VerizonSupport Wired.
@VerizonSupport I subscribed to 150mb , I get 1.5 .
@VerizonSupport DSL Service, was expecting to get Fios.
@VerizonSupport Yes it is , actually can you tell me how much the 100 Mbps internet would cost monthly with taxes and fees?
@VerizonSupport That’s the issue. I am in new construction. But my close neighbors all have Fios availability and don’t currently use fios. Have been told that they just need to add me to system, but I keep getting transferred back and forth. Please have tech support DM me!
@VerizonSupport My entire family. I'm not receiving all of my texts or phone calls. Wireless mobile service. Been going on for a couple of weeks now.
@VerizonSupport We have six (!). We can see the info on channels but no pic or sound. I've re booted box and checked cable many times. I think we need an expert to fix. ??
@VerizonSupport Set top box needed to be reset this morning via phone call otherwise it would not work and the Wi-Fi doesn’t appear to be working after having already been reset as well.
@VerizonSupport One moment as I am currently resetting the router a second time.
@VerizonSupport These are the lights that I have on my router at the moment which are both on (not flashing). https://t.co/I3Xps8v97G
@VerizonSupport Not exactly sure how to mess with this, however, everything seemed to be working fine without the Ethernet before. https://t.co/BVsNm6HRuZ
@VerizonSupport Neither my phone nor my console will connect to the internet.
@VerizonSupport You mean via Ethernet?
@VerizonSupport On the Univision Now app.
@VerizonSupport I was able to log in on the FOX Sports Go app. Univision is not asking for my credentials. It's trying to sign me in with saved credentials.
@VerizonSupport Yes, I've uninstalled and reinstalled and the same issue persists.
@VerizonSupport Both white but my Xbox can’t connect
@VerizonSupport I don’t have a long enough Ethernet cable and I can’t reset the big box because it’s in another room and the people in there are already asleep
@VerizonSupport My phone can connect but not the Xbox. And when it was connected it’s like if the WiFi kept crashing. And now it won’t even connect
@VerizonSupport I tried before contacting you guys and just a lil ago
@VerizonSupport Yeah which I don’t understand why
@VerizonSupport Is there anyway you can check that
@VerizonSupport That’s fine
@VerizonSupport never got a bill every time i look at the apps it’s say not available except today that says your oder have been canceled
@VerizonSupport No one showed up today to install my cable. I’ve waited all day
@VerizonSupport I refuse to keep paying you all almost $200 a month and this crap keeps happening for no reason.
@VerizonSupport That's despite me turning text alerts off in the past, by the way. How many times do I have to turn it off? Now I have to get up in a few hours, and I'm wide awake and pissed. 😡
@VerizonSupport long story short you guys are actually not allowed to provide fios service in my area, some archaic law or sumtin, terrible
@VerizonSupport This is not entirely true. It has to be the router you or your vendor sales. You are even required to input it serial numbers on your ordering website "or the technician won't install service". Your service cancellation process cannot be done online, and calling get you nowhere.
@VerizonSupport The downstairs tv is fine
@VerizonSupport Okie dokie
@VerizonSupport I know that number by heart now. As I said, 4-5 hour long convos w/ them. They claim the issue is fixed. It is not fixed. I can't follow up w/ them after the convo. The same process repeats. How can I get a billing mgr on that line who I can follow up w/ or a VZ office to visit?
@VerizonSupport Only if someone can communicate the truth to me.  Otherwise I’m #done
@VerizonSupport My mobile account.  If you’ve got a direct number of someone I can speak with maybe we can resolve some issues.
@VerizonSupport @115990 thank you
@VerizonSupport It would be an upgrade &amp; mobile
@VerizonSupport Cellular 👋🏼
@VerizonSupport Everything has been moving extremely slow and the 1x keeps appearing and when it doesn’t it just circles. Websites don’t load and some txts don’t go thru 😢
@VerizonSupport Network issues and they need 24-48 hours to address it. Being without the internet is absurd. They are like robots reading a script
@VerizonSupport Yes.That's where the window of 24-48 hours came in to play. Gravely concerned after the 48 hrs I'll hear some other excuse.
@VerizonSupport DSL on router blinking red light...not able to get on internet. Promised yesterday today would be fixed...now they say an additional 48 hrs.
@VerizonSupport No sorry for the way a rep of your company spoke to me? More reason to drop your service.
@VerizonSupport In Staten Island NY 10312
@VerizonSupport Whoops - realized I had accidentally signed into my father's account 😅 but I'm unable to sign into my personal account because the mobile link isn't working?
@VerizonSupport I do not have a User ID connected to my account - I've always done "one-time payments" because of this. When I sign in, it brings me to my family's account - not mine. The one-time payment link is not working and brings me to the same page.
@VerizonSupport Ah ok, so is it possible a national broadcast picked that game up, and wasn't listen in my tv guide?
@VerizonSupport @115990 Sorry about that. Thank you!
@VerizonSupport Thanks, turns out my device was being stubborn - all is well.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport I already called customer service. I already paid the charges. Thanks anyway though.
@VerizonSupport It was for enterprise. After 20 minutes of being on hold a very nice representative answered my questions. However, if this is any indication of customer support, I would not like to endure this again.
@VerizonSupport This was for a second cell line I thought I was adding as a shared plan but was a separate plan just all on my account. They told me I couldn't cancel it immediately when I realized what had happened &amp; had to wait 24 hrs but they shipped the phone!
@VerizonSupport ?
@VerizonSupport Ok thank you
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport I do.
@VerizonSupport Yes, I can.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I did it. Still noting changed. Red circle on router
@VerizonSupport Yes, i know.
@VerizonSupport I did check, its says everything its fine, but my internet does not work. Have red light on my router. Did rebot router few times and still not working.
@VerizonSupport Never mind! I am off hold now. Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Everything from March 7 to yesterday wasn't saved to my cloud even though I backed it up twice and now it's gone because I had to reset my phone
@VerizonSupport Thanks! I have a billing question.
@VerizonSupport It was my mobile account where I was upgrading my phone in your cyber monday sale. I already called and had the situation resolved but still had to jump through too many hoops, all because I'm poor and had to borrow money save money
@VerizonSupport It’s a cellular account
@VerizonSupport Verizon support, I have a problem I need help with.
@VerizonSupport Squirrels birds and wind routinely damage the lines and box on the power pole, knocking out tv phone&amp;internet service for the neighborhood. Has been happening regularly since August. Frustrating when I gotta meet deadlines
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport My bad: Meant to include this pic. https://t.co/qMuaWE28WX
@VerizonSupport Yeah, spent a while on chat today with Verizon.....
@VerizonSupport We already pay too much for the service. True unlimited is no longer offered, and I probably can’t even stream before we get throttled, anyway. So, I’ll just continue to hope on #Xfinity showing up in the area. Greenwood, CA(if you really feel like doing something).
@VerizonSupport Appreciate your advice
@VerizonSupport I’ll need to call you guys....
@VerizonSupport They fixed me up!!!
Thank you much!!!
@VerizonSupport No Fios TV.  Did not check phone... land line though.
@VerizonSupport Not sure
@VerizonSupport Yes.  Press the blue button.  Already spoken to tech support many times.
@VerizonSupport Yes.  Temporarily. Until the next day.
@VerizonSupport I am an existing customer who would like to change my package to the gigabit internet package offered in my area.
@VerizonSupport We use @116136 at the company (FIOS is not available here) and myself and most of our employees use @115722 at home. Our systems work great from home (everything we run is in the cloud) but we are pulling our hair out re comcast at the office...
@VerizonSupport Yes - we have the same issue going through our switch as well as connecting directly to the comcast modem.
@VerizonSupport We keep getting kicked out of our MS SQL database which is in the cloud (employees at home using FIOS NEVER have this problem), the internet just drops intermittently, etc. We've replaced everything on our end to fix. Wish we could get FIOS here - but its not here yet...
@VerizonSupport And than when I go thru all the steps after I troubleshoot it still doesn't play https://t.co/u6elkJvkdC
@VerizonSupport You aren’t about helping existing customers. We are just cash cows. Prices go up, service goes down until we have no other choice but to switch providers.
@VerizonSupport I am back up now. After getting through you awful automated system that talked me in circles and told me to call back then tried to force me into the same automated troubleshooting steps as if it’s stuck on an infinite loop I was able to get through to someone
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport ok: https://t.co/zBaRbZdD57
@VerizonSupport where would i find that information
@VerizonSupport I can’t access internet on phone
@VerizonSupport How do I do that?
@VerizonSupport I don't think I've seen that. Would it be something I have if I had the mandated Fios service through my apartment
@VerizonSupport Ok before I head down there, is there anything else I can try to fix the problem
@VerizonSupport I think I found it. About to try this.
@VerizonSupport Not sure if I did this right but it's still not working, internet light still isn't lit up. Should I have heard a sound on the box
@VerizonSupport It's not the "battery emergency use" is it? I held down alarm silence for a minute and didn't hear a beep
@VerizonSupport I'll try again and hold down until I hear beep
@VerizonSupport Uh, what would that look like ?
@VerizonSupport Nope
@VerizonSupport No it's green https://t.co/dNwK2Sp8nB
@VerizonSupport Sent a message. Hopefully you are more helpful than your supervisor who is being extremely rude.
@VerizonSupport My husband is on the phone with the 3rd cs rep with no success. We are being told again they can't honor the package your original cs rep signed us up for. we've had service for a week. This is terrible and cs reps are rude and unhelpful. What information can I provide?
@VerizonSupport My husband does. Md11328083649. We requested the recording of the sign up conversation where a premium channel was promised for 2 years for free. If we can't have what was offered we will cancel our service. It's bad when you'd rather go back to comcast.
@VerizonSupport They couldn't guarantee it was recorded. Please help us resolve now. They said it will take a week to know if it was recorded.
@VerizonSupport And if it's not? I'm guessing it will be conveniently not recorded. Why can't this promotion be added to our service as advertised and promised?
@VerizonSupport As previously stated, this is the promotion that was verbally promised and agreed to. Not or fault if it was entered incorrectly https://t.co/oXBu3yswEH
@VerizonSupport What is the plan of action if the call was not recorded, as I expect to hear (if I get a call back)?
@VerizonSupport Ok. We'll wait to see. If what we were promised isn't honored we'll just cancel or pressure legal action. A terrible way to treat brand new customers. I will make sure to tell everyone to avoid Fios at all costs.
@VerizonSupport Yes already sent the number in a previous message
@VerizonSupport I can email if you provide a contact.
@VerizonSupport no
@VerizonSupport also no
@VerizonSupport yep
@VerizonSupport alright, I’ll get back to you after I reset everything
@VerizonSupport It didn’t work.
@VerizonSupport yes https://t.co/RExb7Gilih
@VerizonSupport I just tried swapping out splitters and it improved but is still an issue... any other thoughts? Sorry was on vacation
@VerizonSupport I️ would assume it is somewhere in the basement where the main unit is at. This could impact all TVs though?
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport For some random reason there are certain channels that do no come in clearly
@VerizonSupport Nope, and we have two routers(second serving as an extender). One on the 1st and one on the second. My room is on the third, but the WiFi problems are throughout our townhouse.
@VerizonSupport Yes I do
@VerizonSupport Not that I know of
@VerizonSupport Not even letting me run the test on my laptop using the 2.5ghz internet
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport No.. just WiFi
@VerizonSupport This happened. https://t.co/E8tJoKqn3o
@VerizonSupport 5G
@VerizonSupport How? This is another result.. https://t.co/R9SxWBG5it
@VerizonSupport I am literally 4 feet away from the router. Literally.
@VerizonSupport 13 lol
@VerizonSupport The devices I use are wireless, so I’m constantly on WiFi. Should I switch internet service providers since I’m not getting the wireless speeds I’m contractually paying for? I need #wireless service!!
@VerizonSupport Better but still not what I’m paying for lol https://t.co/gveKIAGH2i
@VerizonSupport Even worse download speeds! https://t.co/RhihbZFKVu
@VerizonSupport I'm more concerned with the TVs in my other rooms. The phone is just what I used to show the media server showing up like any other streaming media device on my network
@VerizonSupport The cable box is set up and working fine. It shows up on my home network (visible from my phone, pc, smart TV) as a media server. Trying to stream from a smart TV was successful on a local channel, but not a cable channel. Am I doing something wrong?
@VerizonSupport ✔
@VerizonSupport Where do I start? Over 8 hours on the phone the past 2 weeks, or the bill for the router that we didn’t buy and the fact that we had to go out of our way to return it? And then they cancel our account so we have to set up a new one. And now we have no internet.
@VerizonSupport Yes! You guys disconnected my account!
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport still no reply? Wow.
@VerizonSupport mobile.... all ya need to do is look back in our DMs... ya know, the DMs the person who was "looking into" it never replied back to!
@VerizonSupport Lagging in call of duty
@VerizonSupport 92.22 Mbps for the download and I can’t get anything on the upload because the test won’t finish that part
@VerizonSupport Tried wired and wireless the upload test failed for both
@VerizonSupport The wired test was with a PC and yes I’ll unplug it
@VerizonSupport More than once and they couldn’t help - said I️ needed to wait - then I️ called and you hung up twice
@VerizonSupport How do I cancel TV and just get internet? I don't want router either, have my own. Just want the network connection. I can't manage to do it on the site.
@VerizonSupport @115990 Sorry I didn't pick the right account
@VerizonSupport Got this the first two times https://t.co/ojjfOQirkr
@VerizonSupport Hey, aren't ya gonna help me?
@VerizonSupport Mobile. I tried to call right back but now they’re “closed”
@VerizonSupport Yes haven't been under contract for a month can I cancel
@VerizonSupport Displeased with the effectiveness and efficiency of your cable just cable internet is fine it's better than @116136 net but your cable is unbearable intolerable inept. You two could really learn something from one another.
@VerizonSupport Don't think you can resolve a poorly structured user interface, extremely laggy slow cable unfortunately. Would be nice though
@VerizonSupport So can I discontinue my service in the 1st month of my contract without penalty?
@VerizonSupport @241300 Take ya ass back to comcast
@VerizonSupport The guy i spoke to was, intentionally or not, deceptive. He made it sound like I was going to lose 2 channels. Just 2 channels! Somewhere there is a chat transcript showing this move. It was a dirty move. I would never have agreed to the package I was given. I feel cheated.
@VerizonSupport Okay, that's the key. I am confident that if the chat is examined my point will be clear.
@VerizonSupport And how do I contact? This way?
@VerizonSupport Hi returning to speak to a billing specialist, hoping we can resolve this.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/jfTG7kgT6e
@VerizonSupport okay, I did . The link opened. No one is communicating with me.
@VerizonSupport 3. for Internet. Can I do that and *NOT* be fined a 350.00 fee?
@VerizonSupport I've talked to several support members this evening and no one has been able to help. Maybe you can?
@VerizonSupport I have, and it appears, as far as I can tell, that there is no package that costs $110.00. That is literally the line I cannot (or will not) cross given my other expenses.
@VerizonSupport My contract was about to expire, and I agreed to switch to a different package, but it turns out the channel packer I now have is really lousy. The previous one I had is no longer offered, and I get that. But i do not want the package I now have. The person I spoke to via chat 1
@VerizonSupport No phone service
@VerizonSupport Cell phone. I don't have a land line.
@VerizonSupport @115990 Why what's wrong?
@VerizonSupport WIRELESS
@VerizonSupport No I haven’t because I shouldn’t have a 99+% speed drop from just being wireless and I can’t do a wired Speedtest
@VerizonSupport As I’ve said at this current time the speeds are within the margins as Verizon techs have mention of at least 75% of the purchased speed of 50mb/50mb
@VerizonSupport And I do that all the time when see the problem occur.
@VerizonSupport Doesn’t resolve permanently.About this I was on the phone w/Verizon tech had D/L 20mb+, but U/L 78mb+/-. After they reset connection the U/L &amp; D/L went to 50mb+ and this was over WiFi. Not equipment on my side, it’s on Verizon side that this eventually happens. Not happy
@VerizonSupport It seems that the fix requires having Verizon Tech Support reprovision my Verizon router and reset the ONT.
@VerizonSupport After so many routers and already an ONT replacement it’s occurred with all those pieces of equipment intermittently every so often. The common denominator is on you end.
@VerizonSupport Back to normal for now. This will eventually happen again, but it shouldn’t.
@VerizonSupport Both. On multiple devices. iPhone X, latest iMac and MacBook Pro. Definitely not a hardware issue.
@VerizonSupport Thank you
@VerizonSupport I spoke with two different representatives.  One didn’t know anything and the other was condescending and knew just as little.  Both said you can’t change the hdmi settings on the stb, told me it was a tv issue, transferred me to the wrong department when I asked for a supervisor
@VerizonSupport Thank you!
@VerizonSupport @246573 Happening in queens as well. Rebooted all the boxes no fix. U have an outage
@VerizonSupport All tv’s all channels
@VerizonSupport @246575 Same issue.  ESPN not working.  Westchester county, NY
@VerizonSupport Yes. It seems others have replied in the same area that seems to be an issue in the NYC area.
@VerizonSupport Residential. Some channels are back now but many still pixelated with sound in and out
@VerizonSupport East*
@VerizonSupport @246575 There is video and audio stuttering on many channels and in some cases there is no HD channel.
@VerizonSupport Yes it is! As for the PlayStation 4, the Sony PlayStation Network...Sony holds back the speed on everyone’s connection, there’s nothing I can do about that.
@VerizonSupport Trying it now, thanks.
@VerizonSupport Hi again. Just to let you know the activation link didn't work. System said the details were incorrect even though I rechecked them. Tried using the chat function to get help but the person there said they couldn't help. Referred me back to the 1-800. Which isn't working...
@VerizonSupport Yes please!
@VerizonSupport Activating my FiOS connection. Order no. NY00348859007
@VerizonSupport New account setup
@VerizonSupport still not working
@VerizonSupport YES
@VerizonSupport still not working. all my devices connect to wifi but there is no internet
@VerizonSupport Can it be done remotely or do I need to set an appointment for your tech to visit?
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport Brooklyn, NY
@VerizonSupport Yes. Newburgh NY
@VerizonSupport @247168 This would have been a better first response 🙄 ours says all good too.
@VerizonSupport @247167 What good is that if it's not accurate?   Many channels out in NYC - and logging in, status says "ALL GOOD" https://t.co/jdC9Vuwe07
@VerizonSupport Verizon wireless mobile
@VerizonSupport Ok thank you for letting me know. At least I can hAng up. I’ve been on hold for 33 minutes for tech support!!!
@VerizonSupport NY
@VerizonSupport Raleigh North Carolina. My boyfriend also has verizon with perfect signal sitting right next to me. The issue I'm experiencing has been identified on numerous phones ported from Sprint yet has not been addressed by any of the 6-7 reps.
@VerizonSupport Yes I am in the NY area.
@VerizonSupport Everything back up now, thanks!
@VerizonSupport Ozone Park
@VerizonSupport Thanks. The problem seems to have been fixed in both counties.
@VerizonSupport Scarsdale NY
@VerizonSupport 5 feet
@VerizonSupport Yes, I have to restart it around every 20 minutes.  I have also tried different modem/routers and they all do the same thing.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport There are only 2 mine and one from a neighbor across the street I have change the channel so t is not the same as there's
@VerizonSupport Does not help I have done in the past makes no difference. I can however connect my neighbors it works fine for days but they are on Xfinity
@VerizonSupport Every device on wifi has the same problem. No device is mor than 25 feet from the rougher and the have at least 85 % signal strength
@VerizonSupport Yes, numerous times
@VerizonSupport New @115858 MacBook Pro. Reset router many times. Not on VPN. Only 5 feet away from an unobstructed @115725 router
@VerizonSupport The service interruption resolved itself after an hour b4 anyone @115722 @VerizonSupport took my call. I have to admit, #FIOS #CustomerService has gone down hill since I switched from TWC. On average I wait an hour 2 get 2 a live person &amp; this attempt went unanswered. #fail
@VerizonSupport It works in a couple of rooms,  but not this one..says no signal
@VerizonSupport I did..and it says  no outages  in area. .
@VerizonSupport So when will we receive bill credits since @115722 knows we cannot use the service during this time? "Working on it" is not a sufficient response.
@VerizonSupport I believe it was a problem with gone type of outage. I never spoke to anyone and was on hold for 56 min when the tv seemed to be fixed
@VerizonSupport Forget it now, I waited on hold for an hour and 10 minutes because my cable wasn’t working.
@VerizonSupport No channels would load on any boxes even after hard resets. Over an hour on hold for no one to ever come to the phone I’m just fed up
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Very weak signal
@VerizonSupport Nope
@VerizonSupport ??
@VerizonSupport I did that. And my download is 942.81 and upload is 895.95 but when I run a test on MacBook I only get 193.83 download and 280.90 upload
@VerizonSupport 5G
@VerizonSupport HONESTLY IDK CAUSE IT GOSE OUT FOR LIKE 3-5 secs AND EVEN IF I WANTED TO USE MY OTHER ROUTER I CANT CAUSE YOU ROUTER MESSES WITH MY GOOD GAMING ROUTER YALL HAVE. ROYALY FUCKED IN COD WWII 2 TIMES NOW
@VerizonSupport You guys aren't available in my new apartment. :(
@VerizonSupport Mobile and I can’t even call to figure it out because I haven’t had service ALL DAY
@VerizonSupport Nope. My problem is w/ my cell phone coverage. That's what the original screenshot is from.
@VerizonSupport Yes, the only other Brooklyn location was further away. The incorrect address was close, the correct address was over a mile further...the new router has same issue, so a tech is coming tomorrow. Any chance of getting a credit on my account for the $50 I didn't have to spend?
@VerizonSupport @115990 ok well can someone please help me activate the phone i have the info for the system admin
@VerizonSupport Can you DM me?
@VerizonSupport cell
@VerizonSupport @115990 thank you!
@VerizonSupport Please resend link. I do not see it.
@VerizonSupport Please look at ticket # MAHM01JHPC. All help is appreciated.
@VerizonSupport Help. Third day without being able to set up new account. Is there anyone who can help?
@VerizonSupport I’m attempting to return the extender you all sent; however, the return label wasn’t included. @115817 wouldn’t accept it.
@VerizonSupport NY. The picture is black, laggy, pixilated - unwatchable.
@VerizonSupport Nope. I don’t understand, I complained before about this. A technician need to come a take a good look at the outside connections, because it keeps disconnecting. I took a picture earlier went I was using my computer. https://t.co/ePAXnSa0wT
@VerizonSupport My internet is not working.
@VerizonSupport No, only internet
@VerizonSupport MA
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport I've sent a summary of events to @115990
@VerizonSupport You didn't fix anything.  The issue fixed on its own after a number of hours and after I waited on hold for an hour but couldn't get in touch with anyone.  I ask again, how are you going to make this right?
@VerizonSupport I need u guy to check if there is any problem with the internet
@VerizonSupport Speed test website won’t load, it just keeps refreshing itself
@VerizonSupport But it does the same in Safari too
@VerizonSupport Previous message states that I did reboot router...cleared the cache, no other devices using internet wireless or WiFi
@VerizonSupport This broadband speed test website could be used for a really boring rave
@VerizonSupport Shockingly the only thing resetting chrome meant was starting my transfer over from scratch
@VerizonSupport I live in an apartment building and your link doesn’t work
@VerizonSupport I’ve tried both, even restarted my router
@VerizonSupport Thank the Gods! Honestly, I stopped checking after three weeks.  Got tired of looking and finding nothing.
@VerizonSupport The browser says there is no internet connection
@VerizonSupport The earth icon is red, but the wifi icon is white
@VerizonSupport Not sure
@VerizonSupport I only have the router and the verizon TV box
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/OAP0Dy2HIu
@VerizonSupport This is the only button I found. It’s on the router https://t.co/EZ9dpt7ZmP
@VerizonSupport There is this black box with ‘ONT’ on it. Is it the battery backup unit?
@VerizonSupport I can’t find the button https://t.co/a5zuzXPrS6
@VerizonSupport Is this the button? https://t.co/0N49S5AsHR
@VerizonSupport It works now. Thank you!
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport Giving it a try now thanks
@VerizonSupport Still didn't work I think our router isn't functioning right.
@VerizonSupport Green but our service is little to no connection on all of our devices we have to plug in Ethernet cords
@VerizonSupport Friday
@VerizonSupport We are going to call tomorrow
@VerizonSupport No that's the device the runs everything?
@VerizonSupport Yeah the whole process..
@VerizonSupport What's going on with wifi service in northeast Philadelphia area?
@VerizonSupport Everything in the house is Wi-Fi
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Tried that.  Drops out all the time
@VerizonSupport It's been ok for that last 2 hours.  Frustrating how it drops out at random times every day.  Only fix is rebooting the router
@VerizonSupport Just the usual 2 of us
@VerizonSupport Shouldn't you know that as my tech support?
@VerizonSupport Everything looks like it's working great then crashes and we have to pull power
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport i want your guys internet so bad I just got off the phone with you guys and I’m so upset to hear that you guys don’t offer Fios at my zip code area 75223 is there any alternatives ???😭😭😭
@VerizonSupport Would you kindly PM me more details please?
@VerizonSupport @253395 Been a customer for 5 years and it’s worth every penny. Very consistent service. https://t.co/zK4t7WF3Fe
@VerizonSupport Problem ultimately resolved...but it shouldn't be so hard (and long) to place an order for new service
@VerizonSupport Okay I’ll try it
@VerizonSupport Still isn’t working :( I just turned my tv off for the night
@VerizonSupport No just one tv and one box. Can I speak to a live representative on Sunday or do I have to call Monday
@VerizonSupport How long should I leave it unplugged for? That was the first thing I tried but maybe I didn’t do it long enough...?
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport Ok I got it thanks. You the MVP
@VerizonSupport Yeah I think so
@VerizonSupport The globe light on my router is solid red.. again
@VerizonSupport Home internet
@VerizonSupport New mobile phone
@VerizonSupport Need some help
@VerizonSupport 3.0 wired someone came to my house on your end, said if i want better net “i have to move a couple miles” which im not finna do all that
@VerizonSupport My husband gave up for the night. Will try again tomorrow. Thanks
@VerizonSupport My cell, horrible
@VerizonSupport No link was sent.
@VerizonSupport Yes the SD feed is the same.  Guess it my be how the feed is coming to FiOS?
@VerizonSupport Yes that still frame is from the national commercial break on Ch 694 POP.
It shows up on all TV's and only on that channel so it's not an issue at the house.
@VerizonSupport Cell
@VerizonSupport Yes unplugged it as well
@VerizonSupport It’s red
@VerizonSupport @115990 Yea sorry figured that out
@VerizonSupport Won't even work on tablet now. I Pad keeps saying I have to update it. Have done 20 times. Still won't connect. Always been hopeless. On tablet, won't run on HDMI cable to TV either.
@VerizonSupport Of course. I am very computer literate. This is a problem that has been going on ever since your mobile app came into being. I've been through this with you dozens of times now!
@VerizonSupport I hv sent email,twetted but there s no reply from yahoo
@VerizonSupport seems to be just one
@VerizonSupport Can’t order PPVs ever since I moved. 3 times you guys told me it was fixed and it hasn’t
@VerizonSupport Oh wait they hung up on me AGAIN
@VerizonSupport Your rep, Michael (V702164) was able to fix the issue!! After 3 weeks on the phone he was the only rep able to fix the issue, PLEASE make sure he gets taken care of!!
@VerizonSupport yeah my wifi doesn’t work and neither does LTE
@VerizonSupport By the way my issue is Billing. If you're technical support, please don't waste my time. It's going to make me more mad
@VerizonSupport If I DM you, you CANNOT tell me to call customer service. I need this issue resolved IMMEDIATELY. If you can't help me right here on DM, then dont bother
@VerizonSupport Yes we have all 3 services. Not in an apartment. Battery backup costs extra, no extra $ for that.
@VerizonSupport Service is back. Outage in the area....
@VerizonSupport We have no battery backup unit
@VerizonSupport Probably both but definitely TV. Multiple TVs multiple stations.
@VerizonSupport Yeah, but sometimes you want to watch 1 good game. We have the Jet game and they suck. I hate how redzone flashes between games when you want to watch one good game. Patriots, Steelers &amp; Philly super bowl teams and we never ever get those games. Theyre east coast teams.
@VerizonSupport Payed for iphone cash receipt was handed over but phone was not because of weird additional charges. So i asked for money back but did not get it. Left store with no phone and no money. Basically feel robbed!
@VerizonSupport Live tv
@VerizonSupport Only MTV and has happened for a week across multiple shows / movies
@VerizonSupport Ok I have
@VerizonSupport Freezes. Only channel that does it.
@VerizonSupport All TV’s
@VerizonSupport I don’t believe so. Why would it be only one channel? Ideas?
@VerizonSupport It’s not great , why is my stuff not working ! My cable has no signal and my WiFi and phone is not working wtf
@VerizonSupport I don’t know what that is
@VerizonSupport Duh .. I called Verizon last night they said that they are having an outage and the cable should’ve back working at 1:30 am , it’s still not on
@VerizonSupport same service, skyrocketing cost. especially insulting when new customers are offered WAY better deals.  I've had enough.
@VerizonSupport We’ve done it multiple times!
@VerizonSupport Nope, it doesn’t come up at all
@VerizonSupport I can but there’s no picture. There’s sound though
@VerizonSupport BAD CABLE?! Are you on crack? This is a new box, less than 6 months old. There’s nothing wrong with it. Send a signal or something please I don’t have time for this
@VerizonSupport Nope just one incoming line
@VerizonSupport We tried that but it’s still not working
@VerizonSupport The picture would show for like half a second then I’d get this screen. I can hear it though just no picture https://t.co/8cfbKTBxex
@VerizonSupport Just the cable box https://t.co/y56V9kF7Ch
@VerizonSupport Yes red globe light I disconnected it last night and reset it as well and this morning too and nothing
@VerizonSupport The battery pack has a green light on
@VerizonSupport Its back! Thank you! What do you think was the problem?
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I cant even stream a Video, thats how bad it is 🤬
@VerizonSupport Yes, I’ve tightened the coax cable. It works in the living room always, but the issues occur in the 2 bedrooms.
@VerizonSupport I did
@VerizonSupport New week same result. Full refund please. https://t.co/5H79r7LtTT
@VerizonSupport Yes. Always has been
@VerizonSupport Tried that multiple times
@VerizonSupport I only have one box so yes
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Brooklyn. There’s no customer support line on Sunday?
@VerizonSupport Tried both safari and chrome browsers and same issue on both. You’re website is a mess
@VerizonSupport TV glitching but all other services seem OK. Trying third reset now.
@VerizonSupport We got a message that our system was resetting and to click ok. If didn't work supposed to call. No help there. Manual reset did work.
@VerizonSupport Right now all seems ok. Thx for checking
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport No just television not the WiFi internet
@VerizonSupport Turn it back on with the remote
@VerizonSupport Yes that’s correct
@VerizonSupport Nope it’ll turn off but turn back on regularly when we use the remote
@VerizonSupport Usually occurs when listening to the music channels. The cable box turns off, when we turn it back on it doesn’t resume playing the same music channel, it goes back to the previous channel that was being viewed. Not the press menu screen
@VerizonSupport Will try this and report back
@VerizonSupport 👍🏻 thanks!
@VerizonSupport I just called cause I wanted to order a package and called several times. Last time ended up hanging up. I dialed the Spanish line and NOPE, didn’t get anything. Gave him our info and he had it and because I gave him several PIN numbers he didn’t do it.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport A tech came today and fixed the issue. It only took 4 weeks for them to send someone 🤦🏻‍♀️ A month we paid for really bad svc and NO high def and even some of the regular stations didn’t work. We’ve been customers for about 11 years. I was pretty disappointed.
@VerizonSupport “Sorry you are not authorized to view this content”. Only on Apple TV. Works on iPad and on my Fios box.
@VerizonSupport Yes - at first it displayed a message that our area was experiencing an outage for that channel and it would be back at 2:04pm.  But hasnt worked all day
@VerizonSupport No other channels are affected.  No message at all no on Red Zone - just a frozen image of previous channel.
@VerizonSupport Still no go.  I do get the below now https://t.co/aCGh7wsQCJ
@VerizonSupport Only Red Zone - same message on other boxes
@VerizonSupport We're passed that now.  This is 3 weekends in a row now where you haven't fixed our issue.  Please look at reference # inc00487759.  If my redzone isn't turned on in the next hour we will be cancelling our service.
@VerizonSupport Think so
@VerizonSupport Thanks. You guys took care of it!
@VerizonSupport My 3rd box in 2 months just went bad. This is ridiculous for the amount I pay each month.
@VerizonSupport Because it was ridiculous. Twenty dollars savings. 289 down to 269. No thanks. You have no "deals" for long term loyal customers and I'll remember that. Adios.
@VerizonSupport Hey, you had the deal to let me test streaming. I appreciate it.
@VerizonSupport The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.

Over and over again. Only on bill pay. It's as if, it doesn't want us to pay our bill. Considering your company cannot even change bill due dates, at the very least the website should work.
@VerizonSupport Yes. It’s only the pay bill portion of the website. Garbage website.
@VerizonSupport Nope. And that's great, because since your company seems to not be able to move bill due dates, it's overdue every single month. "There was an error retrieving your bill. Please try again later". Yet, I can lock in a new rate no problem! Garbage. Website. Get it together.
@VerizonSupport the same. cannot retreive bill. internal server error.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport You guys can call me so I don't wait on hold.
@VerizonSupport i need someone to call me
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport So instead of checking for an outage first, it makes more sense to have me try a bunch of random things for an hour that didn’t work?
@VerizonSupport I was told yesterday I could, then I call back and get the run around, departments closed, etc
@VerizonSupport Nice response time!
@VerizonSupport We are saving $100+/month over what we used to have with you guys. It was even cheaper for me to end my contract early and pay the fee.
@VerizonSupport The business hours phone agent said January 15th line restore instead of 7-10 days like the online and off-hours tech support we're telling me. Again, my neighbor on my floor has Verizon dsl. And it's working. My building is 5 minutes away from Verizon headquarters.
@VerizonSupport Business team on the phone said Jan 15. I guess that's what you believe is "assistance". I have an entire building with half of the tenants having Verizon. I guess all 50-60 tenants in my building are on different lines.
@VerizonSupport Wasn't useful the first time. Why don't you escalate this matter to a supervisor in business accounts. Have them reply here or email or phone (cell, of course). I don't need to sit through chat, explain again and have them tell me to call in to tell me Jan 15, again.
@VerizonSupport Yes HR doesn’t handle much they just refer us to speak to the head leaders over our supervisors and they just tell us we’ll look into it
@VerizonSupport Verizon Center, Etech Dallas, Tx Etech is a third party call center
@VerizonSupport Who would I need to contact because if my voice will not be heard I will report to the EEOC and take further actions I’m sorry but I can’t
@VerizonSupport I work for a third party call center though it seems that what’s going on up there Verizon doesn’t know anything that’s going on.
@VerizonSupport Tripple play with 1gig service Phone and whole home dvr. Now I called in cause I come from direct tv genie so I asked about dvr whole home
@VerizonSupport Is there any other way? How could this have happened?
@VerizonSupport Okay I'll do that, but how is it possible the 5ghz connection can work but not the 2.4? I haven't done anything to the router
@VerizonSupport No, straight to the router
@VerizonSupport I haven't reset it yet, but still no. I'll do it in the morning and get back to you
@VerizonSupport Personal settings as in a custom router name and password? If so yes I do have that, but they were set months ago
@VerizonSupport Yep. Network still shows up but I can't connect to it
@VerizonSupport Yes, my 5ghz connection is working just fine but my laptop only connects to 2.4ghz. My phone can't connect to the 2.4 either
@VerizonSupport You're unaware you bill wireless &amp; business together? I think I'll pass on the 'help'. Can't wait for you to try &amp; charge me for cancelling.
@VerizonSupport Area? You mean location or do you mean type of service?
@VerizonSupport in the future will the service?
@VerizonSupport Well who does control it?  Clearly neither Pittsburgh nor Florida are local markets for NY.  Does someone need a geography lesson?
@VerizonSupport Signed up for Fios. Too many times Comcast have fed the bullshit line of “I just saw an email about at getting pushed out”.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes that’s how I know the price changed.
@VerizonSupport You sure? Because the speeds state other wise. How can download be lower than upload at full bars. https://t.co/HLV2Q5CaO9
@VerizonSupport Yes and we’ve reset that when resetting the router
@VerizonSupport Wasn’t too bad of a hold time - got it all sorted, thanks!
@VerizonSupport How's your day going?
@VerizonSupport I pressed it for 20 seconds and it doesn't look like anything happened
@VerizonSupport is this the unit i should be looking at? Replace battery is red, but system status is green https://t.co/TptihMfX5q
@VerizonSupport we lost power this morning &amp; when it came back, our phones, WiFi, and FiOS didn't. my mom spent two hours on the phone trying to figure out how to fix it herself. apparently the next available appointment is Friday morning. my mom and I both work from home &amp; need remote access
@VerizonSupport No, will have to schedule a separate appointment after consulting with a technician. The technician agreed that customer service was incorrect - hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Thank you.
@VerizonSupport I have been having issues with main cable box and internet for over a year. Customer service on the phone unhelpful - tries to sell me an upgraded box. Finally just had a knowledgeable technician come today - told me it's the wiring and an upgraded box will not fix the issue.
@VerizonSupport Support Net Neutrality and I'll stay with your service. Otherwise I'll be canceling my service.  Happy Thanksgiving!
@VerizonSupport Hi, I have already done that but I was wondering if you have an ETA; I didn’t see one on the website...
@VerizonSupport Yes, And it didn’t work.
@VerizonSupport Yes bundle was 139 now its 169
@VerizonSupport Okay. This time I'll put those chat screenshots here instead of DM so we're all in the clear.
@VerizonSupport Still have messaging and the like, no Wi-Fi though. I have an essay due tomorrow and need the Wi-Fi 😩😩
@VerizonSupport cellular
@VerizonSupport @269326 Help is here?  How?  By taking away our internet freedom?
@VerizonSupport @269326 The fact that the current FCC chair used to work for Verizon says a lot. I do blame your greedy corporation for his irresponsible &amp; ignorant decisions. He’s clearly a corp shrill of yours

You will get a lot of complaints over this, but understand it’s not abt the service
@VerizonSupport Jk it hasn’t been a week I’m dramatic. But still curious
@VerizonSupport Why is your company supporting the FCC in Net Neutrality being revoked???? No longer a customer as of today.
@VerizonSupport Yes I was, thank you.  Sorry about the mix up.  My Verizon is for wireless and my fios is for fios obviously.  Have a good thanksgiving.
@VerizonSupport Looking to change from Cablevision to fios
@VerizonSupport Looking to speak with a representative # change
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/BW1SyvQkB5
@VerizonSupport Where is this button located?
@VerizonSupport Just tested it and the outlet does have power
@VerizonSupport The PWR, BAT, DATA, NTWK, and MGMT are the only ones on
@VerizonSupport This is what I see https://t.co/4SL1u163O6
@VerizonSupport Still doesn’t work
@VerizonSupport I have access to it. I tried unplugging and replugging and still didn’t work.
@VerizonSupport Have done this 30 times but will try again
@VerizonSupport I just did and DMd please call or I need to cancel services
@VerizonSupport Please make it right.  This experience has been awful.
@VerizonSupport Cell phone and laptop, yes. I don't know who to call to fix it
And when I go to sign in the page won't load
@VerizonSupport You can DM me, I’m sure no one wants to hear about the experience I have been having
@VerizonSupport thank you, but it's still happening. I hit the DVR button, screen 'DVR Messages' shows. Upgrade or Cancel. Cancel just goes back to TV, Upgrade goes to the DVR Upgrade screen where I can either Exit for Live TV or Ok to Select a $12/mo upgrade which I don't want.
@VerizonSupport I only have one dvr.
@VerizonSupport I aready sent messages
@VerizonSupport Always cellular. https://t.co/ivkwlM95JZ
@VerizonSupport says system error
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I need you to unlock my account so I can register an account online
@VerizonSupport Likely not symmetrical, but for a pretty huge savings I would take the compromise easily. I think I last spoke a few months ago, when my bill had reached $250 per month.
@VerizonSupport That would be great. Let’s do it!
@VerizonSupport Yep!
@VerizonSupport This was for cell phones. It was someone who is an employee replying to someone on Facebook regarding the difference in a Corp store vs them
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport The speed test page keeps automatically reloading because it can’t believe how slow my WiFi is. https://t.co/TYRzPvIHxk
@VerizonSupport Just didnand it’s doing the same thing. Only this time it’ll refresh every 10 seconds instead of every 5.
@VerizonSupport Doesn't that negate the advantages of wireless? My question was are the speeds I'm getting the norm for wifi?
@VerizonSupport Thanks but been testing since install. Wired speed very good 99/101, wireless 42.10/84.47 on channel 6. Changed from channel 1. Happy Thanksgiving!
@VerizonSupport So what is considered acceptable wifi speeds if I have 100/100? That question was not answered.
@VerizonSupport 2.5,  but Spectre x360 15 on the way soon, then 5G
@VerizonSupport Not until the x360 gets here, My current 4yr old HP does not support it. Thanks for the support, enjoy tomorrow!
@VerizonSupport None, I have Quantum Gateway router
@VerizonSupport Wireless, it's a residential connection.
@VerizonSupport I don't have a cable I just moved. And yes it is very good but I signed up for a gigabit not 300mbps.
@VerizonSupport LOL that was even worse. https://t.co/UOcC0DM90V
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/jy0A9Gnona on a Macbook Air, on a Chrome browser.
@VerizonSupport And if that doesn't work?
@VerizonSupport I don't know, it was literally installed today.
@VerizonSupport I will when i het back home
@VerizonSupport Today when i got home i reseted my box and still slow internet speeds
@VerizonSupport @115722 #HappyThanksgiving
@VerizonSupport Can we dm?
@VerizonSupport Yes. But we have had trouble with the line over the last few weeks
@VerizonSupport thank you!! it's a coaxile cord!
@VerizonSupport Oh yes there is one of those!!
@VerizonSupport Every. Single. Thing. For an hour. Just bought the season on @115821 and am watching on my @127972 because it’s 9:20pm and I don’t feel like troubleshooting. Will be switching to Comcast on Friday.
@VerizonSupport Already following. DMing now
@VerizonSupport This. Not to mention I’ve been getting an error message on no less than 4 HD channels on a separate box. For the almost $400/mo we’ve been paying for years it would be nice if things actually worked. https://t.co/dsCiQvzPDT
@VerizonSupport I'll DM now, but I suspect it might be the router. I noticed one of the sides was kind of opened, so I'm thinking it fell.
@VerizonSupport I already checked that. I followed the steps on the trouble shooter. Didn't help.
@VerizonSupport Thank you 💪👏
@VerizonSupport Thank you. It happened a couple of weeks ago and now today with a Verizon Customer
@VerizonSupport We’ve done all that, we’ve rebooted too and nothing still works. And why should we have to continually do this? It’s ridiculous!
@VerizonSupport @30421 will DM you. But don’t reboot my system because I’m recording!
@VerizonSupport Great news! 90 Day Fiancé episode 20 is now available but the sound cuts out near the beginning and doesn’t come back on. I love catching up on this show. Do you know if it will be uploaded again?
@VerizonSupport Thank you for the update!
@VerizonSupport we made payment october 19th, we have the confirmation for this. we missed this months payment by a matter of 4 days.
@VerizonSupport residential account
@VerizonSupport #NetNeutraility why are you guys a bunch of money hungry fucking Jews. Like seriously you guys think you guys can make people pay for websites. The internet should be a free place for people to talk and communicate with each other. But now I guess we can’t because of you people.
@VerizonSupport This isn’t something I can chat back and forth about, I need to speak to someone over the phone and was promised a call back.  Let me know when I can talk to somebody.
@VerizonSupport Never have had such a horrible experience!  Hours and several phone calls later no solution.
@VerizonSupport Really?  You’re so quick to answer online but I’ve been on hold for over an hour
@VerizonSupport Nobody can assist me with managing my fios accounts and tv channels
@VerizonSupport I was promised showtime at a certain cost and everyone I dealt with for my account handled it poorly - I was just on hold for 2 hours waiting for a supervisor
@VerizonSupport I’m waiting to speak to a manager about the account we started today, and they promised a call within 1-2 hours and it’s been longer.  I need someone’s assistance.
@VerizonSupport No. That's why I want to talk to someone.
@VerizonSupport I'm seeing ads for triple play at 79.99/month and I'm paying 119.99. How do I move over?
@VerizonSupport Wanted to talk to you to see if I could lower my monthly bill
@VerizonSupport 07070
@VerizonSupport TY as an acct Mgr for a med-size corp &amp; personal acct holder, I just told @Ask_Spectrum rep I can't    Recommend for my company or myself
@VerizonSupport I checked you guys are in my area, i will call and order fios either Thursday morning or Friday, its a dam shame @115955 having family over and can't even watch/surf anything. #ThanksgivingFail
@VerizonSupport Already talked to you guys. Said you'd send a technician over Saturday. Kinda trash but whatever
@VerizonSupport Cell. There was a fraud purchase on my account that should have been removed over a month ago.
@VerizonSupport 2123342170 is our business line but the PHONE DOESNT WORK so you can call me on my cell 3474663180
@VerizonSupport Ok
@VerizonSupport Quoted a price, agreed to and then not honored. Call for help fixing wires, no work done at all.
@VerizonSupport Keep hearing that from your phone support and they constantly try to upsell and add services.
@VerizonSupport I believe after the rude agent on the phone yesterday I am going to cancel my service, she was mean and nasty.
@VerizonSupport I can call customer support twice and get two different answers to the same question and both tend to be inaccurate
@VerizonSupport Internet is fine, just zero TV channels working.
@VerizonSupport Rebooted the entire system before calling last night. Same error showing. See attached. https://t.co/jc64pBAryC
@VerizonSupport The error means that cable card is not working. I don’t know if I need a system reset signal sent or a new cable card.
@VerizonSupport Had to wait until someone home, coax reseated, error same. Can we try refresh signal, can’t do it thru app w a CableCard. I can DM acct#
@VerizonSupport All TV channels stopped working last night. Not working as I left for work this morning. Have an error msg on my TiVo “searching for signal”
@VerizonSupport I already disconnected my service because I thought I was not in contract, I even called verizon prior to canceling just to make sure
@VerizonSupport Yes I need you guys to waived my contract fee like your reps promised
@VerizonSupport I was told my contract was up and you guys are charging me cancellations fees...how are you going to fix this?
@VerizonSupport I'd like for my contract that was extended without my knowledge to be cancelled (as promised) and for the 210 fee to be waived...simple
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport @115990 Honestly I’m tired of contacting people with your company. No one gives a fuck and it’s pretty clear. If you did I’d have my money back.
@VerizonSupport Wireless service
@VerizonSupport I'm curious. You people really do know that just about every device is connected wirelessly, right? You just ask that to try to avoid responsibility, right? Wireless, using Verizon's POS router!
@VerizonSupport No. But, I did reset your router and this is the result. THIS is what I pay your outrageous rates for, even after the next troubleshooting test, the router reset. https://t.co/zc9MSfafsG
@VerizonSupport Your YouTube live video just says error every time we try to play it
@VerizonSupport North Georgia 30528
@VerizonSupport Yes and on msg go mobile app . Thanks you for your attention and reply
@VerizonSupport It’s always when we try to watch something on demand... either it is pixelated or blurred and we can’t watch the show.  Also, we would have to buy a show that’s on regular TV...
@VerizonSupport Been there. Done that. Doesn’t help....
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/f53HD0FJvp
@VerizonSupport Yes and yes
@VerizonSupport Spoke with some supervisor named Lala (in the Philippines) and supposedly straightened it out. I’ve also been trying to stop your voicemail turned off, I have my own machine. I’ve had to set my machine on three rings so it beats your service and it’s too fast for me too.
@VerizonSupport Frustration... form of punishment?.
@VerizonSupport I tagged you in a different tweet with my issue
@VerizonSupport Whole network out- 5X in 20 days...restored ea time pending equipment update. Your rep refused to troubleshoot inconsiderate of my frustration
@VerizonSupport I am in Tampa Fl
@VerizonSupport @Ask_Spectrum aww man that page just keeps looping to this page :( https://t.co/NZoZKuWa5s
@VerizonSupport @Ask_Spectrum Someone take my money!
@VerizonSupport Yah i got nothin. Are you guys available at 7915 3rd avenue in brooklyn 11209?
@VerizonSupport I have no internet to access your site thanks to @Ask_Spectrum .... but when it's back up, i'll check out your goods. We'll high five later
@VerizonSupport Are you guys working today?
@VerizonSupport I bought and installed a wireless home phone yesterday morning. They said it would be a few hours before I would receive calls...porting. Phone doesn't ring when I call it.
@VerizonSupport Calls go straight to voicemail
@VerizonSupport Already following.
@VerizonSupport I waited there for 45 minutes. No response.
@VerizonSupport I did. Then waited 45 minutes with no response from Verizon.
@VerizonSupport I know you have no intention in the near future to enter the Baltimore market. So now I have to go with something else that works better than dsl.
@VerizonSupport I would love FiOS support. When are you coming into the city?
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport My issue is your employees aren't helping customers in order.
@VerizonSupport All
@VerizonSupport FioS
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport @143012 Updates don’t deliver services
@VerizonSupport Well you've sold me. To bad I can't view the packages yet since my internet is down and my cell phone service usually gets slower when this happens
@VerizonSupport Does your DVR service record up to 6 shows at once?
@VerizonSupport Not available yet.
@VerizonSupport @143012 FiOS in my hometown in PA. These are really the best speeds you can offer? Where is the fiber you were paid by a grant to run to every home? Meanwhile I get 2Gbs down in Japan for $60 https://t.co/XYuAoDpQzy
@VerizonSupport DNS error. And yes, I've reset it and it's plugged in.
@VerizonSupport Second day off in a month you guys have fucked up. Real bummer.
@VerizonSupport I'm tired of paying for this if it's not going to work when i need it to, gang.
@VerizonSupport No just blinks a bit https://t.co/yX0D2t09Ox
@VerizonSupport Yes and that will fix it for a day or so, then i have to do it again.
@VerizonSupport Hell no.
@VerizonSupport Did that earlier. 0 success.
@VerizonSupport I've been working on a phone insurance claim for literally 3 days now and it's the biggest joke I've ever dealt with in my life
@VerizonSupport The previous two techs said they'd fixed it but it's THREE MONTHS LATER and it's STILL BROKEN and TECH IS NOT HERE!!
@VerizonSupport Also, you have been CHARGING ME for my BROKEN PHONE LINE. My line has been dead for THREE MONTHS!
@VerizonSupport It is now past the time window I was given. Can you assure me a tech actually IS coming? What is the tech's name? What is their phone#?
@VerizonSupport Okay, I DMed you. No response. Your tech is now 22 minutes past the 4-hour window. My phone has been dead for THREE MONTHS. #VerizonSucks
@VerizonSupport It seemed to fix itself...all good at the moment..thanks 😍
@VerizonSupport Follow me and I'll DM you exactly what you can do to assist me.
@VerizonSupport ^^^ https://t.co/irVGOBXNry
@VerizonSupport Will do... thank you for the quick reply
@VerizonSupport Reason I asked was because I'm trying to learn French and I want to hear it more and I watch TV a lot so I tried to put 2 and 2 together.
@VerizonSupport Nope. Still haven’t been notified of anything. I can’t reschedule either (which I don’t even want to) because it says error whenever I try
@VerizonSupport Both. They didn’t provide me with the same time it’s saying online but regardless no one ever showed up.
@VerizonSupport ..... It's listed on your website.
https://t.co/HcrhRxwHjq https://t.co/Pc7waTFLpL
@VerizonSupport I didn't, although I received a call 5 minutes ago from New York, and he confirmed that he dialed that number.
@VerizonSupport one might accurately say, they are in the shitter.
@VerizonSupport My router is metaphorically on the toilet and your service is what's coming out of it.
@VerizonSupport I had already tried in Chrome and Firefox. Tried again just now in Chrome and now it shows but still not in FF. Same addons on both 🤔
@VerizonSupport Yes. Same link that's highlighted in the first image.
@VerizonSupport Got a call from someone who wanted to tell me about how they were working a problem that I called about last week. He was indifferent
@VerizonSupport That when I tried to phone @115722 about On Demand problem no one ever picked up the phone. He said that's impossible we're aways here
@VerizonSupport You seem unconcerned that I've experienced a series of bad or nonexistent customer support. I want someone in charge to know about this.
@VerizonSupport Yes, I need for you to convey to someone that every time I try to contact @10309 by phone or Twitter or Chat I can't get my problem resolved
@VerizonSupport Perhaps better discussed via inbox
@VerizonSupport Hello Humans! 🙌🏾. Problems with FIOS/home service. Help?
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport How can they reach you on FB or can I direct message you a name and contact info? She is at her wits ends trying to get this done.
@VerizonSupport They’ve tried repeatedly to reach you. and you were a no show at two appointments. Frannkly, are tried of sitting on the phone.
@VerizonSupport Unless you can give me a number that will solve this, I’m advising her to file an FCC complaint. This is terrible customer service.
@VerizonSupport A general verizon number? She’s already spent hours with you at that number. How can you help her here?
@VerizonSupport This is an old woman who needs her landline for medical reasons.  Very unacceptable.
@VerizonSupport Again, someone from Verizon should be calling HER not the other way around. They have spent hours calling YOU.
@VerizonSupport I understand but I am sure they are done trying to reach Verizon. I think you may be hearing from the FCC about this matter.
@VerizonSupport I am authorized to give you her daughter in law’s name and number by direct message.  She is handing this for her mother in law.
@VerizonSupport Well, what information do you need? perhaps I can supply it to you via direct message.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport TV is in and out. Internet is out. I called and they have a rep coming in the morning. It was installed 6 hours ago and it's already useless
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport About 90% of the time I get an error like this. Would love to be able to download the recording like #xfinity has be able to do for years
@VerizonSupport Yup. Have come to accept that streaming on Fios is just shit
@VerizonSupport My equipment was shipped to my address when I had selected for it not to be shipped because I am not at the residence yet.
@VerizonSupport It won't load...
@VerizonSupport Wireless only
@VerizonSupport I have a Tivo w/ cable card. Not getting Fox channels (such as FS1). I need tech support to verify/reload card in your system. Phone call?
@VerizonSupport Yes.  It says Florio is debating Whitman.  That was '93.  The guide doesn't list #MLBPlayoffs games, rather other shows.  Please update  Thx
@VerizonSupport I have not. Is that the large box installed somewhere else? Reseting is by holding the Silence Alarm button for 15 seconds?
@VerizonSupport YES.. You can look through my replies, someone else around my area had the SAME issue.. Please do something. This is a 24hr+ issue.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Done. Tried logging in again through Bein into VZ which leads me to &gt; If I sign in just logs into my account, doesn't redirect back to BEIN https://t.co/R3apmKJVIE
@VerizonSupport loops this page on their app, their app is terrible though. Has never worked for me. https://t.co/ysfYqSjyt9
@VerizonSupport I tried direct thru fios app on phone &amp; thru bein spts con app on phone fios on pc and bsc on pc
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/diDo9CCnNN
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/FIteTno5W1

@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/MdRJefeAM6
@VerizonSupport So even if bein app doesnt work how do i get to bein sports conn thru fios app???
@VerizonSupport Its not bein sports its bein sports connect
@VerizonSupport I dont understand. Connected thru bsc app buy dropping me on fios page. HOW DO I WATCH
@VerizonSupport No I've never seen this and don't recall being told about it upon installation
@VerizonSupport Yea i rebooted the router and modem multiple times, no luck
@VerizonSupport I tried in different browsers and through the @13668 app, and it breaks. This has been happening for months.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport My mobile services. I only ever have one bar, and I constantly drop calls. It feels like I live in 1996
@VerizonSupport There’s no messages. It’s a little lighting bolt. https://t.co/Qu4sTsCbmX
@VerizonSupport thats what Im tryimg to do
@VerizonSupport It says I am not subscribed to the channel but I am
@VerizonSupport Yes I do on that as well
@VerizonSupport Says I can’t message your account
@VerizonSupport Not really. Fox Sports has a dodgy redirect, but always works eventually. Just tonight.
@VerizonSupport Tried/failed on 3 browsers. @13668  keeps looping me to "sign in w/yr provider." Finally got game from @61521. Thx for trying to help.
@VerizonSupport Can you resend the link
@VerizonSupport I have a wireless connection but can't stream Netflix without it going off several times within an hour. Browsing is now a pain.
@VerizonSupport I have home internet for which i pay a total of about $77 monthly.
@VerizonSupport DSL
@VerizonSupport In bed now but give me a few minutes to hard wire directly.
@VerizonSupport Currently on veruzon speed test page and nothing happening
@VerizonSupport It's hot
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/l05NExedlh
@VerizonSupport My monthly costs are too high and I have other providers offering better deals.
@VerizonSupport my bad, trying to watch the game on the website, prompted with that statement. I have Fios TV and Internet and have logged in. plz help
@VerizonSupport I am currently on my university campus, but this has happened to me multiple times on my home network in the past.
@VerizonSupport I am not, every website works perfectly, but whenever I try to watch tv through espn, nbcsn, etc.; I am prompted with that statement.
@VerizonSupport Yes, my phone, but still prompted with this when signing in https://t.co/WjlULpuAtR
@VerizonSupport It says you need to follow me in order for me to DM you.
@VerizonSupport No problem, the dm has been sent.
@VerizonSupport I’m on a playstation and my game is lagging, and for my phone I’m on an audio chatting service and I can barely hear other peopl’s voices
@VerizonSupport No.. also how does one perform a tracert
@VerizonSupport No I’m on ethernet, and can you do it in terminal on a mac?
@VerizonSupport Sites &amp; apps in general
@VerizonSupport Playstation doesn’t show accurate connection speeds
@VerizonSupport That is a wired speed test, I just took a picture of my laptop with my phone
@VerizonSupport You do realize that’s my iphones camera roll and it’s a picture of my laptop.. right?
@VerizonSupport I did. No help. Help me please.
@VerizonSupport Supposed to be on BeinSports. What channel is that? I found on 1643 but it’s in sd and in Spanish. It’s 2017. Why is ther still SD???????
@VerizonSupport Oh I'm aware. Go figure that sports channel isn't part of the sports package. But I get QVC and HSN!
@VerizonSupport are y’all gonna follow back?
@VerizonSupport Black screen.
@VerizonSupport Signed in and does not show any outages in my area. How do I report an outage?
@VerizonSupport Yes I have all three services with Verizon. Just upgraded to the highest internet speed about a week ago.
@VerizonSupport Yes power is good. Cycled it too. Indicator lights are active.
@VerizonSupport No luck with that suggestion. So frustrating.
@VerizonSupport Yes - status light is green. Tech guy on phone said no issues on your end - but it was working fine - and then it wasn't.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Holding now. Beeped twice.
@VerizonSupport I disconnected it and then lost service. I plugged it back in in case that was the cause but still no luck.
@VerizonSupport Yes just the top green light.
@VerizonSupport Nope. Back with tech support. :(
@VerizonSupport I don't know if you can relay messages - but thank you all here and special thanks to Ponnada for getting me all squared away!
@VerizonSupport aaaaaaand all my recordings are gone
@VerizonSupport That’s the only one hooked to FiOS (the others are just “smart”). All of their channels are normal.
@VerizonSupport Thanks. Will try tomorrow.
@VerizonSupport @32501 (HD516) is back on this morning. Thanks for the response! Hope it doesn’t go blank for #ArrowSeason6 premiere!
@VerizonSupport Where do I send or take it?
@VerizonSupport If it’s actually worth it to you are really sincere then you would work with me to get an actually legit price. Otherwise it’s not worth it
@VerizonSupport Yes, and they are laughably expensive. I’m not paying $100 for that service. Rather take the ETF and get the better for less elsewhere.
@VerizonSupport For caring about my loyalty the people on the phone didn’t even ask why I was disconnecting. Not even a small try to keep me. Just “when?”
@VerizonSupport So you’d rather lose my business entirely then give me a decent price. Ok then. Have it your way.
@VerizonSupport Because “new” is better than “loyal”. Like I said, Comcast is coming and I’m not “loyal” enough at this point. It’s absurd how you price.
@VerizonSupport I’m annoyed that you keep saying I’m a “loyal” customer yet try to charge me $75 more a month for the same service.
@VerizonSupport This LTE internet has been SLOWWWWW I have 3 iPhone 7plus on this account and the internet is slow on them all
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport my remote stopped working. Was told a new one would be mailed to me but received no email confirmation. Was calling to check
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport if I give you my  email can you check?
@VerizonSupport mobile.
@VerizonSupport No Verizon Residential Online Chat for the Contact us campaign
@VerizonSupport 75247 Frontier migrated TX, FL, &amp; CA so it’s only Wireless in TX
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport I have an outstanding debt  with you guys bc @115955 came back on hours later, and I was too young nd stupid 2 cancel 😩
@VerizonSupport That was main reason for call. Now I have now dvr and they want to charge me an additional 20$ I am still waiting on call from a manager sup
@VerizonSupport For 20+ mins. I shut it down.
@VerizonSupport So I just retightened it, and now the pixelated channel changed! Also, don't have another TV.
@VerizonSupport No. Most, but not all as described previously.
@VerizonSupport Internet service
@VerizonSupport So I guess you'll need to send a technician here to deal with it.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Coax is perfect and in tightly. Some channels are perfectly crisp. Others not. https://t.co/mDhNqNPo1Y
@VerizonSupport The internet service, and direct feed of basic TV, have been very choppy. This video is of live TV on your service. https://t.co/XRknXAbocd
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/TFv6fysXRs
@VerizonSupport I am, still will not load it. https://t.co/gedjFNWasa
@VerizonSupport no
@VerizonSupport No, it's 12:30 in the morning &amp; I'm not about to start some troubleshooting ordeal, I just wanted to watch TV.  Another time for this.
@VerizonSupport @71221 @115946 @6005 @130108 Break it down, how much cheaper w/you vs Fios. I like how DVR is incl. w/some of you
@VerizonSupport No red light. Logged into myfiosgateway &amp; all seems ok. Just no internet connection via wifi or Ethernet
@VerizonSupport I only have internet. Have restarted router twice since issue started an hr ago.
@VerizonSupport Every website I get the same message https://t.co/dG9UHuu2VY
@VerizonSupport I have 2 devices connected to Ethernet. No connections are workibg at all...
@VerizonSupport 14215
@VerizonSupport The internet connection. The router and everything is functioning as if there is connection. All cables are secure...
@VerizonSupport Yes, it is set to record now on Sunday, thanks again!!
@VerizonSupport But I was looking at DVR, will try app.
@VerizonSupport Yea
@VerizonSupport Done. Should the battery beep or anything after the 20swc depress.it did not. Also. Restart the modem after this?
@VerizonSupport Still red globe.
@VerizonSupport Looks like we have another outage. 4days later. https://t.co/awpPEagjEl
@VerizonSupport No I click on the show and it says that I timed out I don’t get to the episode list
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport No everything is having problems even free programs
@VerizonSupport No it’s white
@VerizonSupport On hbo on Demand
@VerizonSupport I’m trying to watch game of thrones
@VerizonSupport Its not coming to my area. You guys have already stop expanding your fios program.
@VerizonSupport https://t.co/jkymyCtURJ
This right here shows that fios is not expanding. Its a shame, cause so many people would switch in a heart beat.
@VerizonSupport Look, the signal was messed up from you all coming into the house before the SPLITTER!  Nothing has changed in our house, nor moved
@VerizonSupport I have had this number for over 20 years.
@VerizonSupport I can pay my bill but I cannot set up an account. The system keeps asking for an order number and I don't have one.
@VerizonSupport The https://t.co/5uGVKgFIss page. They also gave me a .net page. I spoke with Tiare for 30 minutes and then waited 10 for tech support.
@VerizonSupport We never connected because she was dropped from the chat. Then Jaime came on the line and after asking me all the same questions and waiting
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport I'm proud to say I'm with u guys now
@VerizonSupport Nope . Just the home internet . The last 3 days we had short outrages.  Last night it went down and didn't go back on
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/rvZMe5AwYa
@VerizonSupport Still nothing
@VerizonSupport One solid green light
@VerizonSupport I do , I did still nothing
@VerizonSupport Nope . No changes
@VerizonSupport I called customer service , they say they have an outage in our area
@VerizonSupport For example, why split CNN from MSNBC?
@VerizonSupport Sure do - cannot get the account management to work on any browser
@VerizonSupport Yes, iPhone7. Intermittently it will drop to dialup speeds, even in well covered areas.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport When we signed up for your service, nobody mentioned to us that the gift card could only be used with Verizon wireless.
@VerizonSupport I did receive a ticket number
@VerizonSupport Thank you
@VerizonSupport @297268 So why don't you? No internet for 12+ hours in the Poconos.
@VerizonSupport Yeah that would be really cool, hopefully the Twitter bot is better!
@VerizonSupport Trying to buy new service. Fiber ops are installed, tho they drilled into my mattress from outside w/o warning. So far, v. unhappy w #Fios 🙄
@VerizonSupport You make it as difficult as possible for me to suspend my service for 5 months. Same price to keep my phones and Internet on.
@VerizonSupport Business trip switch off TV leave Internet and phones on. Barely no cost saving. 248 to 190 for merely Internet and phone.
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport I've spoken with Matthew on the phone and he was fantastic.
@VerizonSupport Cell
@VerizonSupport EVERYONE IS
@VerizonSupport yes on my cell phone. Its really abusive in nature, and they are using many phone numbers. I got 3 today morning.
@VerizonSupport Trying to find out which model of routers from third parties are viable for use with Verizon Fios internet and cable?
@VerizonSupport What is the make and model of your router? And, ANY router is good for internet WITH the Verizon router?
@VerizonSupport So, are you suggesting that it is IMPOSSIBLE to purchase a router from ANY other source BUT Verizon that will provide service to the home?
@VerizonSupport You CAN’T recommend a router that would populate the TV guide &amp; On Demand functions, or you won’t!? On the ones you sell/lease will!?
@VerizonSupport Again...I've NEVER lived in NJ but I'm told that I owe 1448 dollars for a land line there! How does THAT work! I've NEVER been to Trenton
@VerizonSupport Its not working, i see red lights, I'm not satisfied :(
@VerizonSupport Yes the "🌎" one
@VerizonSupport Yeah, my cable just turned off...
@VerizonSupport Nevermind the router and cable needed an update, but it would be nice to get a notification when one is needed. But thank you for the help 👌
@VerizonSupport thank you. it was for a cellular device
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Charging a full month for one day of service due to unforeseen circumstances is not what I would consider CUSTOMER service.
@VerizonSupport B/c the billing cycle starts on 10/9, that cancelling it today and turning the router off on the 7th, we will still have a bill in Nov.
@VerizonSupport people to pay for something they won’t be using you just have to wait for the bill to print, right? That’s disgusting.
@VerizonSupport 1. that page kept reloading doing nothing (a metaphor) 2. i don't trust you anyways so here's proven/time tested ookla and google's results: https://t.co/Ld2PFhAsKq
@VerizonSupport dsl. i was told fios would be coming, it's been almost two years now.
@VerizonSupport pls hold bc @115858 @AppleSupport keeps taking shit off computers and i need to use a 10 year old slow laptop that still has an ethernet port
@VerizonSupport nevermind here are the results: https://t.co/uYF6AZMspS
@VerizonSupport yeah this isn't going to work. will not be able to perform hardwire test. please find another angle
@VerizonSupport I got a new phone and the device and sim aren't compatible so it isn't letting me change my auto plan from $45 to $50 since the plan was old
@VerizonSupport i already tried google chrome and safari. neither worked.
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport residential. the login paid keeps reloading and not allowing me to enter in my info.
@VerizonSupport I just want internet and tv no phone, @119000 says if I get rid of my phone my bill will go up
@VerizonSupport I have to wait longer for my service because the call representative made a mistake &amp; I work from home which I am unable now
@VerizonSupport Scheduling my appointment for service https://t.co/x1K5GRBWI7
@VerizonSupport maybe if you focused on making quality products instead of trying to get as much money as possible from people.
@VerizonSupport Yup
@VerizonSupport phone keeps restarting. did factory reset like i was told. still didnt work. told i could send phone in but be charged for it. THANKS!!!!
@VerizonSupport I keep getting disconnected now. Every few seconds the internet goes out.
@VerizonSupport Was sold internet I didn't need, charged a 100 fee for a contract that I "terminated" but thought I didn't. Your supervisor was snarky too
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport You guys screwing with my billing
@VerizonSupport Call me I need to talk to someone who knows something
@VerizonSupport I am trying to get my info off an old phone. When I remove it it removes it on my new phone
@VerizonSupport I transferred service, was told one thing on the phone, but online rep was giving me a cost that was $50 more when I asked for bill. Not ok.
@VerizonSupport No, they did not. And magically by the end of my chat, we were back down to the amount of my most recent bill going forward.
@VerizonSupport You guys told me I could use my employee discount on the unlimited plan if I switched. I’ve switched &amp; suddenly I can’t use my employee disc
@VerizonSupport Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Be sorry and take something off my bill...can you do that @VerizonSupport?
@VerizonSupport Channel is currently unavailable. Almost half of my channels are doing this &amp; it's impossible to speak w anyone on the phone!
@VerizonSupport Wired, wireless, phones, my on demand channels aren’t working bc the internet is too slow even tho you guaranteed me “the fastest” internet😡
@VerizonSupport The globe is red
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Still doesn't work, even after the reset
@VerizonSupport No just the wifi, but a lot of other people are having the same issue right now
@VerizonSupport Always say but never help. Why do we pay this much money for t.v. we can't even watch?
@VerizonSupport Big shock it's Sunday again https://t.co/v4XZnqnSMq
@VerizonSupport Nope just the one I want to watch.  U pay 13 dollars a month for redzone n it never works. This is absurd I have to go thru this every week
@VerizonSupport Already did that 6 times. I did all the tricks man. We deserve some kind of refund here. Every Sunday it's the same shit. It's ridiculous
@VerizonSupport I gave up already. Im not going thru this every sunday. Ill just cancel . This is ridiculous
@VerizonSupport It doesn't . I'm forced paying for redzone n I've watched it twice out of 6 weeks bc it never works.  I lose Verizon wins again
@VerizonSupport Well I get that but every channel works except of course for the one we pay extra for. How do you explain that?
@VerizonSupport You can't help. We will be calling after football season to cancel services. This is absurd.  Only keeping it til red zone is over
@VerizonSupport You can't turn it around. Why dm so nobody can read how much u guys suck? .  Only way you can turn it around is if you come to my house n
@VerizonSupport Turn the game on for me. Oh by the way anyone know who's winning the #nlds game 4? #cubsvsnats
@VerizonSupport I can't watch it bc Verizon sucks
@VerizonSupport How do I refresh?  I have deleted the app and reinstalled and that did not fix
@VerizonSupport No. Choices for trouble ticket do not seem to march my issue
@VerizonSupport For about a week
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Unlocking my channels to the plan I got upsold would help. Tired of  ‘not subscribed’ messages after I got tricked and paid for top plan
@VerizonSupport Was promised a call back by manager Never received - so u want me to call to be put on hold for 45 min again? Verizon should call me.
@VerizonSupport Got off phone with Mrg Gail. Informed bec we get discount no more disc will be given.  Missed work to stay home for no show tech.  8 days
@VerizonSupport Not yet, but we mostly haven't even been able to use it, we're going to cancel it today.
@VerizonSupport If you can get a tech out today, then I'll keep it, but it's been weeks and so far the techs have missed our service appointments.
@VerizonSupport being throttled after several days. We rely on video/large file uploads for our income. This has been costing us.
@VerizonSupport DSL, but it doesn't work and the service techs haven't fixed it, so we're cancelling it and using the hotspot, but that's already
@VerizonSupport @115911 @117735 @115911 - I would love to switch back bcz of your rates/data plans - is there a way i can try your service before completely porting ?
@VerizonSupport Nope
@VerizonSupport Wired connection, streaming through Open Broadcaster Software. I called in and they couldn't diagnose the problem
@VerizonSupport First time had to wait 2 days for technician. Now earliest appt is 2 days again
@VerizonSupport But I enjoy the mobile app, because I travel for work. I’m always away. I haven’t been able to watch my recorded content in two weeks.
@VerizonSupport I have had it for tonight. Will decide whether to contact you tomorrow.
@VerizonSupport i went through menu-system-etc.
@VerizonSupport @115990 Thank you
@VerizonSupport Says there's an outage in my area.
@VerizonSupport The issue is now resolved.
@VerizonSupport DM sent
@VerizonSupport I've called twice and they said ignore, and wait for next bill. Now getting past due notices
@VerizonSupport No. Order #?
@VerizonSupport Oh it does say "how to pay your final bill"
@VerizonSupport I dispute the entire amount.
@VerizonSupport Third phone call was today!!! I was told they could not adjust bill because it exceeds maximum allowed. What next?
@VerizonSupport I don't see anything saying Final Bill on the September or October statement. Service was unsuccessful in August
@VerizonSupport I tried to get connected with a rep and was constantly getting stuck at the "please tell me the reason for your call" part.
@VerizonSupport No matter what I said, the voice would go "got it" and then immediately repeat "please tell me the reason for your call" endlessly
@VerizonSupport It’s not on local channels in my area. I’m in New York, it’s a Boston/Colorado game, not local. I have center ice to watch non local games.
@VerizonSupport not blacked out. same game is on msg hd and that feed is fine.
@VerizonSupport same thing. but i am getting the feed on msg. OF. THE. SAME. GAME. what is that?
@VerizonSupport makes zero sense. it has never happened before. ever.
@VerizonSupport games over and programming hasnt resumed. its not a game blackout, its some other problem.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/JTWeWDi9DA
@VerizonSupport Wireless mobile.
@VerizonSupport The globe and bottom ones are both white
@VerizonSupport Yes i did it came back for an hour and the wifi service went again
@VerizonSupport No it came back again hopefully the service does not go again thank you!
@VerizonSupport Yes both lights are on
@VerizonSupport I did... It's not going above 100Mbps
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/TjV38bWgwr
@VerizonSupport It is not
@VerizonSupport It doesn’t seem that there is a reset button
@VerizonSupport Seems to have fixed problem. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport No, it's particularly with this application OBS (open broadcaster software). Frames seem to drop every night from 6-10
@VerizonSupport I used device having gigabit ethernet adapter. And above speed test screen shot is also of 5Ghz channel. Tested from Samsung galaxy S8+.
@VerizonSupport I chatted with your agent in morning for 3 hours. Nothing got resolved. I m tired of typing. Call me or send your guy here to check the issu
@VerizonSupport From morning I am typing same text to you. Still haven't got any solution. Shame on your customer service.
@VerizonSupport This is the current scene. It is not even loading. Yes I do have everything. CAT6 cable, your quantum gateway router.  Everything.😡 https://t.co/NqlvcrdyR1
@VerizonSupport It happens at those very specific times of day, though, so I don't think it could be the software
@VerizonSupport Wired or wireless both act the same
@VerizonSupport 2.4 for the TV and Xbox and one laptop phones are on 5g but everything shows the drop
@VerizonSupport Same with speakeasy https://t.co/xBkj73Dvyy
@VerizonSupport Not in the mood to deal more with it tonight, has been a waste of 8 hours over the past 2 days and it is no better than it has been
@VerizonSupport But @115900 shows what we have been getting https://t.co/iGOUkyf8Wt
@VerizonSupport Conviently nothing now https://t.co/2ZU8Lv10Vh
@VerizonSupport Can tell when the speed drops the TV will flutter as it is connected through the internet as well
@VerizonSupport Yes I do, how do I do that?
@VerizonSupport Just pressed the reset button on the black unit, nothing changed
@VerizonSupport I don't use the app. Only the https://t.co/mQb8ZB00iS login flow.
@VerizonSupport Just logged in on the FIOS website. No redirect back to HBO.
@VerizonSupport Awesome, I’ll be there soon!

Screw @115955, I’m going Fios!
@VerizonSupport The TV screen that says I'm no longer subscribed to any channels... don't worry I'm calling y'all 🙄
@VerizonSupport Upgraded to a Comedy Central package and it took away all my original channels...and we can't get them back #bringbackmysports
@VerizonSupport Boston vs Colorado. I'm in NJ. No reason for blackout
@VerizonSupport Well thank you. Fwiw, last night they blacked out Columbus but not the Rangers. Tonight they blacked out Boston but not the Devils
@VerizonSupport I need answers or I'm gonna have to cancel the center ice package. This is absurd
@VerizonSupport Just lift the blackout for the Penguins game
@VerizonSupport You're the broadcaster
@VerizonSupport Who is in charge of the center ice package? Where do I direct my complaints?
@VerizonSupport OK, I'll check. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport Wireless (mobile) service.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport it says i don't get them &amp; need to subscribe
@VerizonSupport Like the thing that plugs into the wall for the router or the thing that gives internet to all the routers? Either way, yes.
@VerizonSupport Also the LAN and WAN light are lit.
@VerizonSupport I just reset the bbu. Still red globe.
@VerizonSupport 23321
@VerizonSupport fios man, and yeah it’s red
@VerizonSupport yeah
@VerizonSupport it’s fixed now lmao, thanks though 💛
@VerizonSupport Area code 87327 and 87301
@VerizonSupport Right. Since you have our money, there's nothing you can do anymore. Lol you are all sad; as a company and individuals
@VerizonSupport It's the same TWO channels EVERY time. Any time of day, everything is blacked out. Even when a game isn't on. It's YOUR issue with channels
@VerizonSupport $180 is more than just an "inconvenience"
@VerizonSupport Thanks! @VerizonSupport guess what? My internets still down!!! 🙃🙃🙃
@VerizonSupport Seems to have resolved on its own. Thanks for the quick reply regardless.
@VerizonSupport Yes, twice now.
@VerizonSupport Should it only take a few seconds for it to come back online? With the green light next to system status?
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Is there any way to know when is maintenance programmed for an area? I'd like to know because I'd like to be able to save my work before having my connection disrupted
@VerizonSupport Yes it is
@VerizonSupport Yes! How do I reboot it? I have the one all the way on the left?
@VerizonSupport Um all I have on there is alarm silence or emergency battery use? So which one?
@VerizonSupport Ok, I did that
@VerizonSupport Cool! I’m back online 🙌🏿
@VerizonSupport Thats what I figured - no problems signing into fios via Fox sports website on PC. Thank you
@VerizonSupport Works fine on PC. When I try to sign in to Fios on the android app, I'm put into an endless loop of singing in again, doesnt return to app
@VerizonSupport I have the recordings proving @115725 lies. No wonder your reps hang up when they know I’m recording #verizonsucks #nointgrity @136958 help
@VerizonSupport Me“so I’ll have zero out-of-pocket costs if I decide Verizon is it as good as they brag to be and I walk away” @115725  “exactly” #Verbatim
@VerizonSupport Red globe. WAN light is on. Already attempted manual rests of both router and ONT.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Wired straight to your modem/router
@VerizonSupport Hello...
@VerizonSupport Really..... Use a Verizon program to test a Verizon service.... Won't be any bias there. 😂😂I attached a pic on my original comment.
@VerizonSupport The original picture was from this morning.... I'm not home now
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport Now im hit with an early termination when i didnt even sign up for a new contract. This is deceiving
@VerizonSupport And still the same slow speed. And no resolution just paying for slow speed. Then my bill jumps up 10 bucks.
@VerizonSupport NO!!! I've cancelled.
@VerizonSupport I took off from work yesterday waiting for service that never arrived. Yes the internet modem. Order number is 42773-51205
@VerizonSupport I have explained the situation several times and to several different ppl with no resolution
@VerizonSupport @115990 Will they contact me or should I contact them via tweet?
@VerizonSupport Turned off my voicemail system because service install date was rescheduled. Not my doing either.
@VerizonSupport Hoping sales person is working that now. How long for order?  How do I get credit for lost service? Cannot replace business I lost.
@VerizonSupport And with whom do I speak to for that?
@VerizonSupport Don't worrie just need a day I won't be super busy in the process of moving
@VerizonSupport DDG? Michigan
@VerizonSupport To be honest you can’t, I called everyday for almost 2 weeks and everyday I was promised that my internet will be restored, it has not been
@VerizonSupport I just wanted it to be know that I am very very unhappy
@VerizonSupport No thank you, I do no want to follow &amp;
@VerizonSupport, I’m don’t talking to your customer service, it has lead to nothing but frustration
@VerizonSupport My local electric company claims it’s theirs, so let’s see what happens
@VerizonSupport IT FLASHES DOESN'T CHANGE COLOR , I USUALLY UNPLUG IT FOR 15 SEC THEN PLUG IT BAQ IT AND THEN IT'S FINE
@VerizonSupport Depends on where we are in the apartment ,The 5G is phenomenal/the devices not compatable are 4G and they go in and out the most frequent
@VerizonSupport YES❗
@VerizonSupport YES , PHONES 3
@VerizonSupport WILL DO THANKS❗
@VerizonSupport WIRELESS
@VerizonSupport JUST WANNA KNOW THE BEST OPTION FOR WHEN YOUR INTERNET IS GOING IN AND OUT
@VerizonSupport They were supposed to get back to me on replacing the power cable from my house to the transformer
@VerizonSupport It started with the FIOS box burnout on my yard
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Mid Sept. thanks for the info.
@VerizonSupport The fact that your associates want to sit there argue with me on the phone.
@VerizonSupport Also fact i told them my internet wasnt working fully in August and I was not paying until it is fixed and they didnt care still want me pay
@VerizonSupport They were but i told them to erase my account completely i am don and I now have Comcast
@VerizonSupport Go ahead send me a DM it wont let me send one to you guys
@VerizonSupport NY
@VerizonSupport @115725 “within the 14 day trial, we’ll go ahead and reverse ALL the charges on your bill” #verbatim Now you want to bully me to pay bill
@VerizonSupport I’ve spoken to over a dozen @115725 reps &amp; have been hung up on. Nobody wants to do with this rep promised me would be done. WILL YOU?
@VerizonSupport 1. Absolutely unbelievable. Acct 454-349-094-0001-08. After speaking with several reps, was told $39.99 would be extended for 1 year. Just
@VerizonSupport 3. required technical support locally, the gentleman was awesome. But the billing support has put the worst possible taste in my mouth.
@VerizonSupport Customer service fixed the problem!
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Picture quality poor across several channnels and STB’s
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport @VerizonSupport verizon says call to MCI and I call to them and they say they don't have my service. Still nothing!
@VerizonSupport Hello... the problem persists and I dont receive help yet... 4 weeks without service!!!
@VerizonSupport Nope, just one specific episode, and any time I've tried to watch it for the past few weeks.
@VerizonSupport 10 year customer Upgraded in Aug ~ 5 hours on phone. somehow old account and auto pay were cancelled.
@VerizonSupport 90 min on phone today to pay bill and reset autopay- bill still not payed and autopay not set up. I refused to pay fee to pay by phone.
@VerizonSupport should've been fixed at 11AM. The last rep spoke to me like I was a 2 yr old and transferred me rather than deal with me. Im done for today!
@VerizonSupport Is there a way to speak to a supervisor to resolve these issues.
@VerizonSupport Nope.  Apparently they dont want their equipment back.
@VerizonSupport called support # taked to someone for 10 min got forwarded and hung up on.
How hard is it for verizon to send a UPS truck to pick up epuip?
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport I'm not sure, everything is running slow today.
@VerizonSupport How do can I talk to a live person.....
@VerizonSupport THAT IS THE PROBLEM!!!!!  NO ONE WILL PICK UP THE PHONE.....I know am on hold on my cell phone and my office phone.
@VerizonSupport Thank you it has been fixed!
@VerizonSupport 10 mins ago.
@VerizonSupport Wireless!
@VerizonSupport Taking away features and adding on fees man please this shit fuck aggravating to pay for shit service
@VerizonSupport Yes, it was for a Wireless account; however, I don't live in the US, and I haven't had any accounts with Verizon.
@VerizonSupport Yeah it's affecting all of them
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/1Fyg0a0cma
@VerizonSupport The main one doesn't, our secondary ones upstairs have splitters
@VerizonSupport DSL. Trying to get a repair on an outside line
@VerizonSupport Ok please follow me so I can dm

@VerizonSupport no
@VerizonSupport Ive been on this call for 34 minutes and counting
@VerizonSupport I just need to schedule an appt with a technician to come tomorrow for job site. Fyi i am still on hold
@VerizonSupport 1. Customer rep cant decipher if I was calling about a personal account or business even though i stated that im calling on behalf of my job
@VerizonSupport David from Social Media team just got me cutover in about four minutes.  Easiest cable card re-assignment ever.  Kudos to your team. https://t.co/kYRrdLahfQ
@VerizonSupport Take a look at my record and you will see why I am frustrated. I told your customer service rep to expect this because I am so dissatisfied
@VerizonSupport Have had no Internet all day. Light on FiOS box is red. Zip code 10128.
@VerizonSupport finally got a support person on the line, tx
@VerizonSupport Fios and it’s been a nightmare
@VerizonSupport Yes, basement. I have checked it, green light for system status. Tried unplugging and plugging back in.
@VerizonSupport The only way to truly help is to find a phone that has vanished. We traded it in at a store they were supposed to send it in. But yet to one can find the tracking number. So we were told we just had to pay....
@VerizonSupport I'm trying, but I keep losing connection.
@VerizonSupport Yes, on other side of the basement
@VerizonSupport Okay, I did that and reconnected the router. Nothing yet
@VerizonSupport They did, as does the person in the other unit
@VerizonSupport Yes it fine now. My husband figures it out
@VerizonSupport I reset the router and the Box under it its only with my macbooks on the network everything else works
@VerizonSupport Both and yes the extender from verizon
@VerizonSupport no just when the extender is connected to the devices
@VerizonSupport It says invalid password. But it isnt
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yep both connections
@VerizonSupport I did that and it worked
@VerizonSupport Huh... site seems to think the slowest you have is 50/50.... I only ever seem to get 20/10 except at 4am and pay for 100/100.... zip 22030
@VerizonSupport Both. And a mix of iOS, Android, OSX and Windows 10.
@VerizonSupport Aaaaand you go and @ me 😒 y'all got my phone hooked up to dial up? My shit slower than @315920 football career...
@VerizonSupport I don’t know what that is
@VerizonSupport It just doesn’t make sense I go upstairs in my house WiFi works downstairs nothing
@VerizonSupport Whenever we got it they put it upstairs in a guest room but we have never had a problem until this weekend
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Yep
@VerizonSupport Im sorry how do you check that
@VerizonSupport I’m sorry were do I look to even see that
@VerizonSupport There is not one with a 5g
@VerizonSupport The only thing we got was a roku for our tv but like i said it was working  fine until this past weekend it was even working yesteday
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport I am not sure but I don’t believe it has
@VerizonSupport I just did
@VerizonSupport It did not
@VerizonSupport I downloaded it but I have no idea how to sign in I don’t know a user is or anything
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Correct
@VerizonSupport Two
@VerizonSupport Yeah it’s says no internet connection
@VerizonSupport Yes the minute I go downstairs with my phone it doesn’t work nor does the roku
@VerizonSupport I have already tried that and it doesn’t work
@VerizonSupport 1
@VerizonSupport Pixelated and freezing.  All the time.  Yes I have rebooted the box.
@VerizonSupport I know 'you' are new to this, yes, since install 1-20-17.  Box replaced, line checked, coax checked
@VerizonSupport Thanks but I like watching on my tv not my iPad or computer. Really annoying. Very greedy. @304914 @191353
@VerizonSupport Its fine on the SD channel(88 vs 588). Tried reseating and its the same. Game is on CBS this week so can Watch there. I'll check again after
@VerizonSupport Hi, this issue is still going on. I checked the wire from the tv all the way out of the house. Channel 503 just completelu went black.
@VerizonSupport Just as a note, nothing in the house has moved for a long time. Could it be an issue with the box outside the house where it comes in?
@VerizonSupport No all 3 cable boxes aren't working stating that there is a network error. Internet stopped working as well. Rebooting did not help
@VerizonSupport That worked. Now it's working. Thank you!!
@VerizonSupport NBC live. Been trying to get it authenticated for 20 minutes
@VerizonSupport Surface Pro, didn't work in Chrome, working in Edge. But, in Edge, headphone jack doesn't work. So freaking frustrating
@VerizonSupport Will try right now. Also, while watching using Edge, headphone doesn't work. Works everywhere else. Thoughts???
@VerizonSupport If I watch a past episode on https://t.co/irKVRK4m4e, headphone works fine. Only not working on live stream
@VerizonSupport Oddly only on the live stream. Watched it on their site later and headphones worked fine
@VerizonSupport It’s affecting everyone I know who has this company as their cell provider. It’s been a reoccurring issue for months.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport I held it down for 15 seconds. Next step?
@VerizonSupport Internet is light is back in but none of our devices are picking up our network as available
@VerizonSupport White
@VerizonSupport Ah, ok. I was able to connect using that info, but it is still just as slow as before the reset
@VerizonSupport I can't even get the page to load, that's how slow it is :(
@VerizonSupport Trying on iPhone 6 running iOS 10.3.2 and then MacBook Air running macOS Sierra 10.12.5
@VerizonSupport Right next to it
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Already did that last night &amp; nothing changed
@VerizonSupport I don't think so? I was sent to the speed test link last night but it was too slow to even be able to load the website
@VerizonSupport It’s been time honestly, I’m just hoping my building gets fios soon is there any way to request it ?
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Riverdale and it keeps telling me to restart my browser 🙄
@VerizonSupport I didn't pay for any of them was the first 3 episodes of season 4.
@VerizonSupport All three did in my box.
@VerizonSupport Sorry. I will when I get home. I'm currently not home until Sunday
@VerizonSupport The situation is corrected. They all say free now. But before they did say 2.99$ for episode 1-3 of season 4.
@VerizonSupport Can’t get stream pass to work. It’s saying my line is incompatible
@VerizonSupport @115990 I thought you were Verizon Support? Which twitter is for which purpose? @317874
@VerizonSupport Phew nvm false alarm. It finally came back up after another restart
@VerizonSupport Thanks, you too!
@VerizonSupport Wired device? Its 2017 i dont have anything connected via Ethernet.
@VerizonSupport Im using a galaxy device how do u connevt specifically to 5ghz
@VerizonSupport Ok im connect next to the route and these are the speeds now still not what im paying for. https://t.co/NHlEDnEBRo
@VerizonSupport This is what your link says. Definitely not true. I have a brand new galaxy Note 8. And it worked fast only this device before https://t.co/OXKjaTlBJc
@VerizonSupport No i on my 5ghz that's y i askd how to differentiate betwn each WiFi signal Speedtest frm Okoola has been true for almst evry WiFi conextion
@VerizonSupport Yes every device thats connected.. rumpus 2.0
@VerizonSupport Im not even a month in to my service and i need to troubleshoot my router? This is ridiculous.
@VerizonSupport the globe on the gateway router turns red for 5 minutes and then goes back to white and back to red every five minutes
@VerizonSupport sorry I meant, is Verizon internet available for 10032 zip code? Last time I checked it was not, I want to use your service.
@VerizonSupport As long as the outage in my area is fixed by the time I was told it would be I'll be happy.
@VerizonSupport Any update on VAC8040Q8V?  Tech been to house yet?  #TicketFollowUp ??? Can we confirm no more ghost 911 calls???
@VerizonSupport Us having to take time off work to meet a tech to fix an issue caused by your techs is shotty business.
@VerizonSupport A DM will not silence the issue. The account has been closed. Besides that, the second phone line to the address cut. We've already ported.
@VerizonSupport A disconnected line "magically" calling 911 is a waste of police resources AND puts my family in a potential legal situation.
@VerizonSupport all the yellow ones.... just have trouble connecting, no service when I connect my devices at all..
@VerizonSupport I did 3 times
@VerizonSupport It wasn't connecting to your servers and was showing me a red world icon for about a half hour but it is up and running now thank you
@VerizonSupport We have fios
@VerizonSupport Philadelphia,Pa
@VerizonSupport WiFi constantly being interrupted, work from home constantly delayed, sent someone, switched our box, same problems it’s really frustrating
@VerizonSupport Just yesterday, Thursday and Wednesday internet has been turning off n on , constantly having to restart modem, constantly putting password
@VerizonSupport Yes the whole house is affected how can this be fixed?! I loved the service before there were no issues just the last 7 months has been hell
@VerizonSupport I do not like to complain I really don’t complain period unless I feel I’m being violated at some point. I work very hard n just want this..
@VerizonSupport You’re really making it sound like it’s 3 easy steps...I guarantee I’ll be goin thru the same thing when I get home so I guess we will see
@VerizonSupport Send someone or I have no choice but to go elsewhere
@VerizonSupport Like I said u guys make seem like it’s 1-2-3 east steps....it’s not...cuz my internet still isn’t working right n I’m home so idk
@VerizonSupport Please fix this or send someone it’s stupid n annoying n I can’t be dealing with this, y’all messing with my money cuz I’m far back on work
@VerizonSupport Can’t do it
@VerizonSupport YES ITS NOT WORKING VERIZON don’t u get why I’m upset or am I talking to a dumb ass computer
@VerizonSupport Til u send someone or else I’m out..it’s stupid n I don’t have time for BS excuses,,,I’m in corporate homie...cut the bullshit #TY
@VerizonSupport Idk what you’re talking about...idk how to switch channels I don’t see it,,,this modem doesn’t have that or idk,,,we are not experts
@VerizonSupport My Fios app
@VerizonSupport Wireless division picks up every time
@VerizonSupport What other number would I put in as it’s the only phone I have
@VerizonSupport When the automated system picks up, it asked for number, not what service I need, not giving me other options
@VerizonSupport Put any of that in the actual options.  Stop arguing with me and just make the process better
@VerizonSupport I’m already though it, I just want it to be a better experience for myself and others in the future
@VerizonSupport Make a better service
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/etL5qXmEIM
@VerizonSupport from __email__ subject: Thank you for your Fios Order - MA00339717563 .. Also some about privacy, Hurricane Maria etc
@VerizonSupport I am now following @VerizonSupport  Can only DM if you do also follow me.
@VerizonSupport Hi, and No, I haven't received any emails since. Let's assume we can call this a success! If I receive anything I'll contact you again.
@VerizonSupport Still nothing.
@VerizonSupport I tried, but I'll try again.
@VerizonSupport I've tried on my computer, PS4, and phone but nothing has worked. The earth light in the wifi light is on as well.
@VerizonSupport Ok I will, but I have to leave right now.
@VerizonSupport No. I can still watch YouTube though, which is weird. I have to use data to browse the internet as well.
@VerizonSupport Agent said she couldn't change total. I can't believe she had no leeway to help a 25 YEAR CUSTOMER. Again, 😠😠.
@VerizonSupport Bill went up $30 cuz promo ended. Got new promo. Next month prorated bill STILL $20 over. I want this removed, discounted, whatever. RRRR.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Then got new package. But next bill (prorated) will be $20 higher for that one month. It shouldn't be. Pls fix. #rrrrrr
@VerizonSupport That is why I would be reaching out to you no? Family member just upgraded from iPhone 5 (?) to 8
@VerizonSupport Hello?
Please send the link.  Its not in the Tweet
@VerizonSupport I’m transferring service to my new house tomorrow. I thought I’d have service at my current apt today but it was disconnected this morning.
@VerizonSupport Yes. I was told it was too late because “the transaction already happened” and couldn’t be reversed.   I was offered the chance to start 1/2
@VerizonSupport a “new” account for 1 day, but that it could take several hours and a possible tech visit for service to be restored so I bailed. 2/2
@VerizonSupport we called last night &amp; there is a ticket. we are not in market 4 either game as told to us by YOUR REP. we should get every out of mkt game.
@VerizonSupport idk. it's in your system. idk if they gave it to my husband.
@VerizonSupport If you ever have fios in zip code 80020 I would immediately.
@VerizonSupport Traveling to Guatemala, and I wanted to know my options for calling and data usage
@VerizonSupport The salesman told us that we could move over shows on our old DVR to the Verizon DVR (not true we just were told today) &amp; that the Verizon DVR only holds 100 hrs of HD shows but that varies depending on the content of the program(s) we record).  Very displeased :(
@VerizonSupport They couldn't help, they did confirm that the Verizon salesperson lied to us when he came over and sold us on using Verizon.
@VerizonSupport No ticket number.  They confirmed the information I was given today by the tech who came to install Verizon and said they couldn't do anything else.
@VerizonSupport No, we told the tech to leave because the salesman lied to us about the HD DVR boxes.  We're staying with Optimum because of the DVR issue.  The tech said we would get an email telling us to return the box of stuff Verizon sent us, we haven't rec'd the email yet though.
@VerizonSupport Ah okay, the tech said we would be getting an email lol so we'll wait for the return kits then, thanks
@VerizonSupport I tried the link but it says that they cannot find our order.  How do we return the box without a label?  Do you need the order number?
@VerizonSupport The link says I have to provide an order number to access the return label or we can sign in but we never opened a Verizon account so have no log on or password for the site.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Ok thanks. How do i return a digital adapter?
@VerizonSupport Is that the only option? There are none close to me.
@VerizonSupport That will work. When i get my new set top box i will contact you
@VerizonSupport And then what? I’ve already stated that takes me to equipment manager but i dont see where i can add a STB
@VerizonSupport There is no VIDEO tab
@VerizonSupport we have your DSL... which is horrible... not fast or a good connection...
@VerizonSupport Beginning of October to resolve issues.
@VerizonSupport Yes I did.
@VerizonSupport Since you have MTV I will be looking into it
@VerizonSupport A unauthorized charge was done. A Manager from FS should have called an hour ago. We have not heard from anyone.
@VerizonSupport That’s some sucker shit Verizon
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/Jhl5J6ryJ2
@VerizonSupport Internet overall very sensitive and terrible, No red light. Cable not working at all, &amp; "we'll call you" service disconnected 2x. Your move.
@VerizonSupport @324997 Intermittent, plus "poor or no signal" on both boxes.
@VerizonSupport Ah, New Customers only. Comcast new customer deals are better than FiOS existing deals. Thanks.
@VerizonSupport Richmond, VA
@VerizonSupport Current customer
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport Full web version does not appear to have an alert or a way to express interest in a location. https://t.co/xVdU39EuF6
@VerizonSupport Hmm maybe on the full web version. I'll look again later. On the mobile site, I don't see that. Thanks
@VerizonSupport Only thing I see on that site is to call. Is that the method you refer to?
@VerizonSupport Yep. Order number and everything. Not like it matter since you can’t get it together to send me a damn email
@VerizonSupport Every. Single. Device.  Including TV with internet connection. The only time I don't experience site issues? When I use my cell ATT data.
@VerizonSupport Average: 27.29 Mbps
@VerizonSupport At this point I'm not confident in the #security of my @115725 account or how much they really care about protecting it
@VerizonSupport Red. I did the just did the ONT reset and waiting for it to recycle.
@VerizonSupport New service, mobile
@VerizonSupport Do I receive it at home as part of my FiOS package? Yes.
@VerizonSupport Yep. All things Verizon here!
@VerizonSupport The problem is MAJOR LAGGING during gaming!
@VerizonSupport The router, quantum gateway upstairs wired to pc. Downstairs Xbox one to settop. Games lag. #12YearOldIsMiserable
@VerizonSupport Problems with gaming on Xbox one.  Internet connection to Xbox is the problem??? Can we get a tech to house for free???
@VerizonSupport Nah id rather have u walk us thru and fix it
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/3Sz78eysdb
@VerizonSupport I guess 5g because that is solid green lite as in 'the video ive attached several times. https://t.co/z2YATxM0FX
@VerizonSupport How do i do that? I'm not tech savvy
@VerizonSupport Thats what I'm trying to find out. I need to get extender??? Which one extends the furthest?
@VerizonSupport Your supervisor Carrie said she was going to call me back and I haven’t had a response yet. I only have an order number 🤷🏽‍♀️
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport No, I have not, but me. Prescott, a very professional customer service associate called  with an update. Probably 2017 DSL service call #5
@VerizonSupport Been seeing this messages the last few days. Similar messaging online too. https://t.co/apDUaEeptR
@VerizonSupport Same thing on a different computer in the browser. https://t.co/Mex4q54jM1
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport I’m almost at the end of my contract and would like to drop double play for just internet. Not seeing that for existing just new customer
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/SstVGRv0AA
@VerizonSupport Fair enough? Can I get an older box?
@VerizonSupport Then why do people I know with Verizon currently have them supported?
@VerizonSupport Blacked out in Philadelphia on https://t.co/1jGEAuXfhf, no link to watch on Verizon site, but can watch in FiOS app on phone
@VerizonSupport Page Not Found

Page requested could not be found
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/3SsSVW5b6a
@VerizonSupport Well I have 2 VMS's should i do them both &amp; then do the rest of the TV's?
@VerizonSupport Well I'll try it but it's not going to be tonight. So the problem is on my end not with @6592
@VerizonSupport Thanks but If If I can't get this resolved when I try it I'll call Fios directly.
@VerizonSupport Summed up, returning phone got the box through fed ex, assumed you wanted back through them, drove 30 minutes to get told to go to UPS
@VerizonSupport Yea I need you to not scam me. You added charges to our accounts. You don’t even notify us and send it to collections
@VerizonSupport That would be nice
@VerizonSupport It won’t let me dm you
@VerizonSupport Home internet. Dsl far below 1 Mbps! Had twitter discussion with other verizonsupport but no solutions. Off to bed now. Wasted hours.
@VerizonSupport The tech support in India said supervisor would look @ problem &amp; call me in 1/2 hr. That was  3 hrs ago. What's with that? Typical V MO.
@VerizonSupport Subscribed for 3 Mbps. Fastest Verizon can supply at my location apparently. Regrettably.
@VerizonSupport Web pages still so slow to load.
@VerizonSupport 1.22 still lousy. But better than 0.11. now full web pages loading
@VerizonSupport That test was on speed https://t.co/2Fkg74vOFp. Verizon site won't load. I'll try again
@VerizonSupport Don't understand last sentence. My DSL slowed over last few days now nearly dead. Why doesn't Verizon ever call as promised? I'm so fed up.
@VerizonSupport 22102 Nothern Va
@VerizonSupport And another text on Friday morning at 11:06 AM saying you'll be here between 1-5.
@VerizonSupport I've got a text verifying the appt. Then you showed up to an empty house on Thurs at 2pm and closed the ticket because no one was here.
@VerizonSupport So then the yelling started and after elevating thru 2 levels of management the folks in your Virginia office got someone here around 8pm.
@VerizonSupport Though it happens even with devices close to the wireless router, and just started on all the devices Sunday or Monday.
@VerizonSupport And it affects just about every website (and may work fine for multiple minutes at a time, but then browser gets stuck at "Connecting...")
@VerizonSupport Payment was made yesterday 10/20/17 between  5:55 p. and 7:00 p. I've been trying to cancel it frantically ever since.
@VerizonSupport And why the CS rep I spoke to say they were aware of it and there was nothing they were going to do about it?  (check call logs)
@VerizonSupport I don't have Netflix, only Hulu to try to "cut the cord" as mentioned.  So yes.  I have pcaps to show streaming rates over time.
@VerizonSupport None of any significance.  I know full Gb is likely faster than some site's connection, however &lt;5Mb from Hulu?  Doubtful.
@VerizonSupport I'm a 25+yr network architect.  Problems like this are what pays my bills and feeds my family.
@VerizonSupport Website or their content servers?   There's a difference ;)
@VerizonSupport I suppose... you do realize that their website and where they serve content from are different correct? https://t.co/nZnCoVeAyK
@VerizonSupport There's hundreds of them.  If you can figure out this then you can definitely wireshark an address too, but yeah, I'll do the work for you.
@VerizonSupport Now what?
@VerizonSupport Sure... been sitting here watching it do this for about 3 mins now... https://t.co/aE0lyMpf4U
@VerizonSupport Next? https://t.co/vGFWYTsOMi
@VerizonSupport *sigh*
@VerizonSupport Oh it's beautiful now.  I was 700+ up/down before. https://t.co/ywlr2Ftprk

@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport Seriously... there is no problem with my network, router or your modem.  CS rep admitted to throttling.  Can you disable it or no?
@VerizonSupport Can you please undo whatever you did you drop my internet speeds? https://t.co/CFZqAUyrZd
@VerizonSupport I'm getting 500Mb+ speeds up/down everywhere BUT Hulu, where I'm getting &lt;5Mb.  Zero traffic policies enabled on my end.  Explain please.
@VerizonSupport No outages. I still have the red globe on my router.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport That worked. Thank you!
@VerizonSupport Fios. Last night in a chat with you guys I was told it was something with my IP address and the guy reset it. It was working fine until now.
@VerizonSupport No, all the lights are green.
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport On demand is working. Internet is connecting now. Went out for an hour, do you guys do some kind of maintenance around 12-1 am or something?
@VerizonSupport All
@VerizonSupport I believe it’s a feed issue with the network.  Everything else we are watching is fine.
@VerizonSupport 2.4 for Nest / Dropcam &amp; Ring
@VerizonSupport I tried unplugging it &amp; plugging it back in.  Is there another method?
@VerizonSupport 17.83 / 26.07 A slight improvement but poor.  Can I upgrade the router?
@VerizonSupport Any idea why it's not working well wirelessly? I'm going to call VCS on Sunday to try to change channels for 2.4 1st.
@VerizonSupport Yes. Still says try again later or call. Not gonna call tonight, wanna do it online
@VerizonSupport Verizon it's not use it's Direct &amp;ssTV the only problem with Ver
@VerizonSupport If Verizon gave me a stronger wifi or wideband but it's not use it's direct TV
@VerizonSupport Enterprise.
@VerizonSupport I'm aware that there's a major security flaw that affects my phone, the LG G6, which has yet to be patched.  Is a patch for it in the foreseeable future, or will it come with Android 8?
@VerizonSupport Trying with IE. Only see eternal loading circle. Blank page.
@VerizonSupport Same thing. Page just flashes no icon to click. Large dots on bottom changing color.
@VerizonSupport I don't get it . It's not letting me DM you. I'm following. But won't recognize @verizonsupport.
@VerizonSupport No FiOS &amp; I check regularly 4 updates. Yet Verizon keeps sending me Fios flyers. But slowdowns &amp; inept phone tech support forcing me 2 cable
@VerizonSupport As in my photo. Takes forever. O.11 down. Ping 1084 upload not even measured. Not enough connection
@VerizonSupport Waiting over 2 minutes for page to load. Now only some words no speed test no icons to click. Page keeps reloading like broken record.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport -To stream on a regular basis. Totally not cool and love if someone could be sent to my home to fix this.
@VerizonSupport No change to the router when my internet cut off
@VerizonSupport Wireless but I'm no more than maybe 10 ft. away from the router on my laptop.
@VerizonSupport I can but I don't understand why the connection via wifi wouldn't work from only 10ft away.
@VerizonSupport All devices that were connected to my router were affected. My laptop, phone, &amp; tablet were disconnected from the internet.
@VerizonSupport Very nice deals. Too bad you don't think client loyalty is just as deserving. Not happy
@VerizonSupport Insult to injury, just opened my bill and it went up! You’re kidding, right?
@VerizonSupport Medford Ma
@VerizonSupport need to change my bundle because you increase price. how can you help??!
@VerizonSupport is anybody answering the phones at Verizon???
@VerizonSupport If I could open the app I wouldn't need a trouble ticket. You people are not very understanding.
@VerizonSupport Yes if I’m having trouble with it?
@VerizonSupport Can’t test my router considering I have no internet with it.
@VerizonSupport And the cord doesn’t fit my laptop.
@VerizonSupport All but internet. Green.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport 👎 negative
@VerizonSupport Yes hots it’s been for 11 Days now.
@VerizonSupport I received the information as to why  the channel was removed but you increase my bill now I’m paying $250 no thank you

@VerizonSupport Yes I am
@VerizonSupport Sure thank you for your help
@VerizonSupport My home number. I had set up installation for Comcast on the 7th of October. The installation couldn't be completed because of a bad line
@VerizonSupport so we rescheduled. Today the port request went through and now I don't have a home phone and I need it back desperately. It should be ported
@VerizonSupport Same terrible and slow service I've been experiencing for years
@VerizonSupport Nhl network and hbo is lagging

@VerizonSupport It’s a bit long for a tweet. Anyway I could talk to someone?
@VerizonSupport That I had only days ago. But was told my original rate couldn’t be restored. That seems pretty unfair... Even wrong to me. END

@VerizonSupport @115990 I think I’m going to switch services to @124441 13 years later!
@VerizonSupport WIll talking to you here waste my time like calling? Are you open Saturday or not? I don't appreciate the run around I get when calling.
@VerizonSupport Residential. I need to close an accout, but after 20 min pressing buttons it said they're closed, only open 9-4 on Saturdays. Really?
@VerizonSupport tech just called thanks though
@VerizonSupport Asking you. How do you.
@VerizonSupport the globe one that signals no internet connection is solid red
@VerizonSupport Checking that now.
@VerizonSupport Internet customer only. Have done all the usual testing with the router, including reset.
@VerizonSupport No not now, but when we do need help it's never pretty. I sometimes rather visit a dentist office for root canal.
@VerizonSupport I did call in and your stupid recording said you're closed and simultaneously that you're open 9-4 on Saturdays.
@VerizonSupport I do. And big surprise, it was useless
@VerizonSupport I don't have service, you broke your contract and never got me service. I was told I wouldn't be charged and now I'm receiving bills saying that I owe money thats late and you've sent it to a collection agency.
@VerizonSupport Fios.
@VerizonSupport Have done so also via online help too. Wonder if there's an outage or repair problem in the area
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport All my neighbors who have Verizon Fios are not having service. You sure there's no outages in prince William county Va?
@VerizonSupport Thanks. We all have same problems. We'll have technician out if not fixed tonight.
@VerizonSupport After dealing with your garbage service (or lack thereof) for well over a month I thought I was done with your poor excuse for a company but here I am dealing with this nonsense
@VerizonSupport Thank you guys my dad is getting you guys install tomorrow after moving Into an area where FiOS is possible I was just wondering where I’m gonna put it in wondering if that’s why but thank you
@VerizonSupport I've been hearing that for ages man. Maine is ignored!
@VerizonSupport Thanks. I rec’d the email on Monday night. I tried using the app &amp; web to provide my mother with access
@VerizonSupport @117310 #Univision #fios you should go back to the negotiating table. Don’t take it out on the faithful subscribers and fans.
@VerizonSupport Just living room. Other 2 rooms okay
@VerizonSupport In and out.
@VerizonSupport Verizon Mgr was v competent &amp; helpful. Found in accnt record multiple request over multiple yrs to remove listing fee.  Never done.
@VerizonSupport This is AWFUL customer support.  I got LUCKY today that I got a competent manager.  What about all past incompetent reps ?
@VerizonSupport I believe so. There's a bit of a language barrier so I normally reach out on her behalf. I have her acct info if needed.
@VerizonSupport I do follow, we should be able to DM
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport How's this? https://t.co/vzPWsL5nSu

@VerizonSupport Didn't work
@VerizonSupport We only have 1 landline phone.  I don't even know where another jack is.
@VerizonSupport Still no land line.  Tried the the Alarm Silence button thing several times and unplugged the phone from both power and phone jack.
@VerizonSupport Verizon Mgr today said the my bundle cost $61.99/mon despite what it shows in my online account.  Said online accnt “not real-time” Whaat ?
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport What’s the best number to call?
@VerizonSupport @AppleSupport I'm done.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport @115725 The website almost never allows me to look at my account
@VerizonSupport The picture on NBCSPPA H 576 is very pixelated. All other HD channels are clear as a bell.

@VerizonSupport FiOS. Internet and Video is out.
@VerizonSupport MD and Fail lights are red. Pwr, Bat and MoCa lights are green.
@VerizonSupport Just got in contact with a Verizon representative and there is an outage. Services will not be back on until Sunday around 1:30pm.
@VerizonSupport Is there a way to find out if there is an outage without logging in?
@VerizonSupport i haven't tried anything. i unplugged it and plugged it back in. still happening. up to you to do the rest. im not screwin with this for hours for what i pay.
@VerizonSupport no clue. its upstairs. im not sittin in front of it. its never happened before. youre signal has continued to weaken until this happened. feel free to semd someone over to sit and stare at the lights and figure it out at any time. but it aint gonna be me
@VerizonSupport nope. i dont know enough about this stuff to mess with it. my IT guy came here to set it up. cant disturb the anything that connects me to work server or pop whatever. cant hit reset. cant change IP address. id be toast.
@VerizonSupport no clue what a customer setup means. i assume so because i have zero clue about IP addresses and i'm not messing up a half a dozen devices. i just know your service has dropped and is now cutting on and off. obv connected now
@VerizonSupport i dont know what it is. thats the entire point. nothing has changed here in a decade. i want someone on your end out here to check it out. from the main box, back. u guys keep screwin with stuff. im already paying for nowhere near the speed i signed up for
@VerizonSupport dont have a wored device that i know of. one laptop. two kindles, one ipad, three iphones.
@VerizonSupport its dropped out three times since i sent that last reaponse
@VerizonSupport nope. tbqh, i'm tired of troubleshooting with you for free. discount my bill for the next month, or get someone out here tomorrow. this really shouldnt be my problem
@VerizonSupport done. quit putting me off. ive unplugged it three times. i have a clear view of the sky in 360 degrees from my house. semd somebody out here

@VerizonSupport Considering your speedtest is refusing to even run! and keeps reloading itself! I'm going to go out on a limb and say the results are Poor to S--t at best
@VerizonSupport Youtube is work again and I can SEE what i'm watching again. I was bitching about your service over all. Because we live outside of town (3 Miles) you slow and reduce our speed and quality because of the distance to reach us.
@VerizonSupport its plugged into a regular outlet, been a customer for years had all types of your routers but none act like this new one
@VerizonSupport Residential. Internet is not working for the 5th day now.
@VerizonSupport Well now I’m being told that I will have to pay for a technician to come out and fix the problem because “one of my devices are blocking the others from@receiving internet”. I’m not a computer whiz but I don’t think this is possible. Also I’m not paying for it.
@VerizonSupport I am.
@VerizonSupport Can't access my FIOS account via email address, account number, phone number, or account name. Your website won't recognize any of my info.
@VerizonSupport Same problem. Can't access my account through any of your services. No way to pay my bill. And your chat is down!

@VerizonSupport no my father is the verizon customer and pays the annual verizon bill
@VerizonSupport i didnt know til i checked at least most of my favorite shows are on local
@VerizonSupport It looks better now after turning off, and on again. Maybe it was an HDMI handshake issue.
@VerizonSupport Yes, FiOS eventually was able to port the number over
@VerizonSupport At which point, I told VZ rep that it’s a deal breaker bc we’ve had the number for so long.
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/jM4uZ7qXlg
@VerizonSupport Wired
@VerizonSupport All of my devices slow down at the same time. Never used to happen when connected to 2.4 version on same router.
@VerizonSupport Yes. It's definitely a hardware thing. Have others complained about the older routers that you supply?
@VerizonSupport Nope. It used to be fine but I've noticed in the past month a significant decline and I can no longer toggle between the 5g and 2.4
@VerizonSupport Verizon Jetpack, MiFi.. Local office sold me 4g, saying I have 4g service. Doesn't work, primarily 3g
@VerizonSupport Yes, it's happening sporadically....disruption in the #Massachusetts market??
@VerizonSupport Yup. Like i said it's sporadic...perhaps an effort from the MLB at some drama ;) it reminds me of satellite TV...in and out due to weather
@VerizonSupport Everything is good and connected on my end...I will certainly notify if anything changes. Appreciate the swift response #thanks
@VerizonSupport We did hat, didn’t work
@VerizonSupport Hi, we unplugged it for ten minutes but it still didn’t drain. How long would it take?  Can it be disconnected or manually reset?
@VerizonSupport Verizon repairman told me I wld never see FIOS where I live. Why does 3g not work? It has taken hrs to pay 2 bills online. Writing chk fastr
@VerizonSupport When will you offer 3g or 4g in zip 23009 that consistently works? Would love to get Netflix and others
@VerizonSupport I paid my bill yesterday and should’ve gotten a credit for the Up program but it hasn’t showed up yet. ):
@VerizonSupport Hi, if my phone is on a month to month and I upgrade on an installment plan will my monthly line pricing go up?
@VerizonSupport Yes, didn't change a thing. Nothing is working still. PLEASE GIVE ME INFO on how to get a service guy to come fix this shit. [Part 1]
@VerizonSupport [Part 2] Your internet is absolute ass and I'm not going to keep having to bitch and complain about your service when I'm paying $172 month
@VerizonSupport One other network. No excuse for my internet suffering
@VerizonSupport It says it is. Baby Driver
@VerizonSupport I’m afraid to click it cuz last time I did that I ended Up buying a movie I hated https://t.co/BJ5vPdxQzp
@VerizonSupport Wait so just pay for it? That’s crazy hahah why do I have all these “rewards” if I can’t use em for something like this?
@VerizonSupport It’s not coming up as an option. It’s either rent or buy not rent or buy using rewards points
@VerizonSupport Lost $250 credit for signing up FiOS and then keeps getting bombarded with calls about a late payment. Horrible customer service.
@VerizonSupport not that old. this season's. but I'm not seeing ANY episodes of Versailles when looking thru On Demand
@VerizonSupport Brooklyn NY
@VerizonSupport I am actually a Verizon fios customer already but thinking about switching since its cheaper with the optimum's fall deal

@VerizonSupport Ok but everything else works fine https://t.co/Xh9mi7lWxG

@VerizonSupport I know if I use your guys’ Speedtest I get no issues, but I don’t see how this is the speeds you guys promise.
@VerizonSupport Multiple times. I know the signal isn't as strong from the router but these seems be particularly poor
@VerizonSupport multiple times to work, Google home device sometimes stops songs suddenly in the middle. Happens on every device connected to the network.
@VerizonSupport The wifi shuts off once in a while then I lag a lot I keep disconnecting off the wifi
@VerizonSupport yeah! I called recently and they said that they fixed it but it got worse
@VerizonSupport yeah, and the router is in the basement where the computer is at
@VerizonSupport sometimes it changes to red

Thank you.

Must say not a good start from breaking off that comcast teat.
@VerizonSupport I’m not sure how I will be able to tell if my phone’s connected to my DVR, but this is what I can show you: https://t.co/3q3Te6i80M
@VerizonSupport Your DVR does not let me record a time, it forces me I record a program at a specific time. This is bad.
@VerizonSupport It doesn’t matter: if the show is removed and something else put in its time slot I lose the recording.
@VerizonSupport @5958 I've got to say. Regardless of the app, the Verizon FiOS login is always a headache.
@VerizonSupport I am following you
@VerizonSupport I am
@VerizonSupport All of them. 2 pc, mac, android. Rebooting router again after 10min poweroff
@VerizonSupport Yes. Tried both Pc&amp;mac hardwired, noluck. Maybe universe is telling me to go outside, rockhunting instead.
@VerizonSupport This is still happening! The guide still says “extra” tonight at 7PM on channel 4. Even on the app!
@VerizonSupport I can in the morning. I’ll tweet back then. Thank you for the quick replies!
@VerizonSupport The guide information says “extra” for tomorrow 10/24 at 7PM
@VerizonSupport I'm on the phone waiting for a CS rep now, thank you.
@VerizonSupport That depends on who you ask, on the phone now for the second time, 29 minutes with this CSR and shes still confirming my phone #
@VerizonSupport I'm pretty sure she won't.  I am having trouble communicating with this rep, i have asked to be transferred to  another CSR 4 times, still .
@VerizonSupport basically just what the heck I'm supposed to do with a router I don't even need anymore :P
@VerizonSupport made it clear I reset the box and everything. CBS is working perfectly fine, red zone and fox are not working right. It’s a prob w service
@VerizonSupport Same problem with service and now to lose a day of work so I can wait for a technician to come back for the same problem.
@VerizonSupport Yeah. So no finishing work today and all tomorrow morning. The joys of Fios 🤷🏾‍♀️
@VerizonSupport Is regarding y’all bad service. Don’t act like I don’t tweet to y’all every week about it.
@VerizonSupport Issue with my bill. I was supposed to receive a call back but never did.
@VerizonSupport I received 2 bills. one in my name, one in my husband's name. same service, two different prices.
@VerizonSupport I tried to. They were supposed to call my yesterday, but no one ever did
@VerizonSupport Unable to use TV or internet at all. Checked all cable connections, restarted all devices and boxes. Getting this on TV: https://t.co/LujBDCZgpW
@VerizonSupport It’s a blue one but yes
@VerizonSupport I just specified in the tweet above what happens
@VerizonSupport I hate Verizon! Came to fix - still not working. Trapped in voicemail hell! I better get a credit for this. #IHaveALifeToo #hiremorestaff
@VerizonSupport Nothing works...26 minutes on hold now #notahappycamper was told "wait time of 4 minutes"
@VerizonSupport Ran the entire troubleshooting guide in the app (took &gt;1 hour so far) and am now on hold on the phone - which lies. 4 min wait more like 14+
@VerizonSupport Only other thing in the house marked Verizon https://t.co/kgXa3XI12F
@VerizonSupport The audio has been cutting out on AMC. You will have lot of The Walking Dead fans mad at you if this keeps up. ;)
@VerizonSupport Ah only happening on one. All connections secure. Reset box?
@VerizonSupport Reseated the coax and that worked! Thanks for the prompt customer service...best CS I've had with Verizon. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport I would expect a credit then for the inconvenience.  There is probably a system wide outage in this area again.  I need a ticket #?
@VerizonSupport Sorry for the late reply so yeah, it's my router which is a Vzn Frontier router so what do I do now? Thx!
@VerizonSupport Amazon new
@VerizonSupport Just guessing, Imight be wrong, I get avg 35 w/ wired 2 w/ wireless
@VerizonSupport Ok thx
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport It's only thr redzone channel all other channels are fine
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/ALcYqMEfuM
@VerizonSupport I did. Your interface is  behind Comcast. No incentive to stay with VERIZON. We need something new. Voice search and Netflix integration
@VerizonSupport @115990 Is Verizon still doing the $600 if I switch @115714 @sprintcare  is terrible 2 hours no answer confused care agents
@VerizonSupport Confirmation was received within the app. The text came after.
@VerizonSupport No. I told the app I’d pay Friday. This request was accepted in-app. THEN I got the text.
@VerizonSupport a repair ticket VADQ0NUDE6 was created &amp; was  tobe  resolved on 10/13 by 12:15am. Havent seen a truck. at all. and its an medical emergency
@VerizonSupport I Understand. Just will make sure to be compensated
@VerizonSupport 517. Message comes up and says unable to tune to the selected channel. Try again. Won’t change the channel. All other channels work
@VerizonSupport We have been promised by 3 different agents at 3 different times that we will be getting a call back for our inquiries. We have been on the phone every day last week trying to keep our services with Verizon, and no one wants to help.
@VerizonSupport There’s not even an option to DM you
@VerizonSupport It’s now showing any game - it’s showing some Simpsons special.  You ruined my day, FYI
@VerizonSupport Yes.  Your guide showed the Cowboys game on at 4PM, when I checked this AM.  Got home and turned the TV on and now the guide shows different
@VerizonSupport Who cares, you lied about your coverage, I want my money back
@VerizonSupport RI
@VerizonSupport Well it would have been nice your guide told me that, but it misled your RI customers.  So now what?
@VerizonSupport It is correct now, but your guide showed different this morning.  You need to give me a credit for ruining my day.
@VerizonSupport Every week it's the same thing. Some video and then frozen.  No message other than channel unavailable
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/pgFonR4ACI
@VerizonSupport No, I do not. I only have verizon for my phone plan.
@VerizonSupport At the sign-on screen is keeps looping saying "please wait".
@VerizonSupport No. I don't have the FiOs app. FiOs isn't avail in my area
@VerizonSupport Residental.........started @115725.com
@VerizonSupport Completely unhelpful. I’m in a rental b/c of a fire in my home so I have no account access. Is it so hard to just say yes or no?
@VerizonSupport It almost feels like an account provisioning issue, but I don’t recall making any changes to the channel lineup recently.
@VerizonSupport For example 509 doesn’t work (CBS) but 550 does (USAHD).
@VerizonSupport Doh! I found the fix. Note to self. Cats can unplug cables sometimes when they run around
@VerizonSupport Fios.
@VerizonSupport Yes, and your accounting department admitted it was a mistake on their end and said it would be handled yesterday. They also agreed to pay the overdraft fees if there were any (and guess what? there are!) I inboxed my number to the verizon main DM. Someone had better call me.
@VerizonSupport Yes and two days later
@VerizonSupport You are welcome to call me about this (no robots) @ (804) 306-8103
@VerizonSupport Can’t get any help with my On Demand Cable TV service. Why do you never me to use ny bonus pts accrued to rent movies????
@VerizonSupport All of the movies I have scanned have the “My Rewards Eligible” tag like “Dark Places.”
@VerizonSupport Back to @116602 losers
@VerizonSupport I found it but see no option to use points
@VerizonSupport I already did that. Points do show up for that movie but it doesn’t say how many points are needed
@VerizonSupport Okay
@VerizonSupport I ended up losing most of my points for a film I’ve already seen. 🤣
@VerizonSupport All other channels are fine. Just one bad channel
@VerizonSupport Yeah. That doesn't fix it.
@VerizonSupport Dm me please?
@VerizonSupport Verizon wireless mobile
@VerizonSupport Residential, but I'm talking to someone now. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport This is the second time in 2 weeks that this has happened. I called your support number and had no success of a refund
@VerizonSupport Purchased travel pass last year and there was no data cap. Son is overseas and now can’t use the data we were told would be available.
@VerizonSupport Yes, but I will send in a private.
@VerizonSupport DM'ing you now. My husband has been on the phone for about an hour with someone telling us they can't help. Punting to you!
@VerizonSupport Previous owner had Verizon, I have comcast... I can’t remove this ugly thing from my wall, and I would like it gone. Yesterday. https://t.co/qq7ah6P04W
@VerizonSupport Oaklyn, NJ
@VerizonSupport Owner.  DM me, will be easier
@VerizonSupport Was promised nfl red zone... Dont have it
@VerizonSupport i had a residential account – fios internet
@VerizonSupport It just doesn't work. It says there's a network error or something. Then I restart the app. And it works for 3 minutes. Then stops.
@VerizonSupport Yes. We've been rerouted to many different people. We have a red light on the router and none of the representatives are using that info
@VerizonSupport Following. Can't DM you
@VerizonSupport @115990 We’re at Sossaman/Queen Creek Road. Using Wi-Fi Calling but @116021 Cable gets congested. So caller can hear me. I cant hear them.
@VerizonSupport I don't want to move my service I'd like to please cancel. I called that number and was told by automated message that ur closed right now
@VerizonSupport It's not for cell service, it's to cancel my cable and Internet
@VerizonSupport So which number do I call? I literally got directed to an automated message that cable and Internet customer service is closed
@VerizonSupport This is absolutely infuriating and very frustrating!
@VerizonSupport I will never use this service again if I do not figure this out. This is the third time, I just want to cancel my acct bc I'm moving.
@VerizonSupport I’ll definitely be looking into it ❤️
@VerizonSupport My google Pixel 2 doesn't have the option to enable wifi calling. I've been on the phone 4 reps from Verizon to google.
@VerizonSupport Would like to get on the phone but been on hold for 43 minutes!!
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport and I really don’t feel like sitting on hold with you guys for 45 minutes so what should I do?!?
@VerizonSupport no wireless is working...cable is out
@VerizonSupport tried it. Nothing...
@VerizonSupport No. tried calling customer support, after 8 pm no one can help me? What a joke. I don’t pay $140 a month for this crap.
@VerizonSupport yes
@VerizonSupport did that and nothing has happened
@VerizonSupport Ok so now I’m getting a message saying there’s an issue with poor or no video signal on the STB
@VerizonSupport Nada. Same message
@VerizonSupport Crickets https://t.co/OoWFPNTLox
@VerizonSupport We already tried that. This service has been going to hell for a couple weeks now
@VerizonSupport Cellular.
@VerizonSupport Thanks. Not sure about other TV. We are all in LR watching our fave show. It's happened 2-3 times in last 30 minutes.
@VerizonSupport Can’t. Get a blank white page.
@VerizonSupport Thank you so much!!!
@VerizonSupport Oh no.  This is in Spanish again
@VerizonSupport @45051 this is the 4th straight week that my @363097 broadcast is in Spanish
@VerizonSupport Yes, it was just the game
@VerizonSupport Just one
@VerizonSupport I think I found what you mean. It just instructs me to go within 10 feet to test WiFi, correct? I get 10/10 in the same room as router.
@VerizonSupport I don’t see a WiFi analyzer in the app. It keeps walking me through a hard wired test.
@VerizonSupport Laptop, mobile devices
@VerizonSupport I dont plug devices into router anymore - just connect via password protected wifi via router.
@VerizonSupport I'm not sure what that is, how do you change it ?
@VerizonSupport 5.0
@VerizonSupport Ok tell me which one to chose https://t.co/RG3gCrPfQt
@VerizonSupport 9 channels and 18 networks listed for 5.0
@VerizonSupport What do you want me to do with it
@VerizonSupport This ? https://t.co/4wHd97S1tQ
@VerizonSupport It told me to reset my router, so I did and still not better and I turned off the 2.4g network too
@VerizonSupport WHAT KIND OF INTERFERENCE IS GOING ON ON LITERALLY EVERY CHANNEL?!
@VerizonSupport I would but my internet is too slow
@VerizonSupport No, one is the router speed test and the other is a wireless speed test
@VerizonSupport i checked it on my laptop. also it connects to the 2.4GHz network only
@VerizonSupport well no but thats not the point. my desktop has both wireless and wired and is significantly better speeds on wireless than wired
@VerizonSupport i did and they all gave me the same results.
@VerizonSupport even direct connection between computer and fios router i get the 75 cap
@VerizonSupport i did they give me the same results even different lengths yield same results at well
@VerizonSupport its the exact same as it is now https://t.co/EubA5ptIYq https://t.co/npvNAqXhgN
@VerizonSupport Wireless mobile
@VerizonSupport wired speedtests are great. 
But as soon as I load up @15542 or @75982 and try to stream to @119038 all frames drop. #throttled
@VerizonSupport Xsplit and OBS both show dropped packets at 90% - 100%. Traceroute attached. https://t.co/gOatcqt6dr
@VerizonSupport I've tried switching ingest servers, adjusting bitrates, changing resolutions, so forth and so on. @118797 would you care to chime in
@VerizonSupport this is the second month that i realized the price hike!
@VerizonSupport Internet, and I pay extra for the top package you offer which makes it more frustrating
@VerizonSupport There is no light. It won’t stay on. When I hold the battery button it flashes and beeps and it’s off.
@VerizonSupport Its already been done. I always have problems with @115725
@VerizonSupport That the channel is currently unavailable. Box has been reset.
@VerizonSupport It's 2 of our 4 TVs (it only works in our bedrooms...). We have tried to re-set the boxes that are not working.
@VerizonSupport My connection is slow, and my wifi signal is too weak for my PS4
@VerizonSupport Speed issue with all devices, but with my PS4 is connection issue
@VerizonSupport can’t do wired test, but here’s the wireless speed. from my mac book pro https://t.co/0tqaBV6NUf
@VerizonSupport nope, and I still can’t connect my PS4
@VerizonSupport ok
@VerizonSupport This is for my mobile phone
@VerizonSupport Now 90 minutes btw... Internet down for several hours despite router reset
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport So I called in tonight and after waiting on hold, spoke to someone, who transferred me than I got disconnected. Called back and have been on
@VerizonSupport Ordered new router 9/22. It never showed. Keep getting messages asking me to return the old one and still don't have the new one a month ltr
@VerizonSupport Yes, I do
@VerizonSupport Thanks guys I love y’all
@VerizonSupport What’s going on with Univision? My father in law has to watch the news 😒
@VerizonSupport I have tried chrome, ie and edge. Same on all 3 going on 20 minutes now. https://t.co/qzPZ6qJnIN
@VerizonSupport Residential. Attempting to renew my contract.
@VerizonSupport I have cleared cache on both chrome and IE. Same results. Also tried on a different computer. Same.
@VerizonSupport rebooted. Same. I can get to everything except when I click on "specials deals" or "renew now" I get hung up with it looking for deals.
@VerizonSupport Yes I am able to login. When I click on renew now the website gets hung up. I can watch tv from the browser, it recognizes my account.
@VerizonSupport I have tried on 2 separate computers. Can try on a 3rd.
@VerizonSupport Already did that. Device 3&amp;4. Same. That's 3 pcs and 1 ipad.
@VerizonSupport Its lit orange. I have restarted the router multiple times
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport Its back thank you
@VerizonSupport Yes I have
@VerizonSupport Red! I've unplugged it and plugged it back in and done everything I could before calling!
@VerizonSupport Sadly you're not available in my area. #Cambridgema
@VerizonSupport Not my point. According to your guide nbc does not exist anymore. True?
@VerizonSupport I already do. 20778.
@VerizonSupport yes it is but it is still rejecting the correct password.
@VerizonSupport Last time I checked, yes. It’s in the neighborhood but not my building.
@VerizonSupport Right, not the best of solutions. :) I'm assuming the ultimate answer is no then?
@VerizonSupport now shows last month owed 44.01 instead of having a credit.  Nothing is matching up to what was discussed last month about getting credit
@VerizonSupport Don't know what I am seeing cuz line items are not online for total.  I want to see requested service change &amp; STB return.  Calling support
@VerizonSupport Not set up on auto and pretty sure I didn't go past the due date on last month as I def did the month previous and payed the $5 on last bill
@VerizonSupport All other channels are fine. Only ESPN is without sound.
@VerizonSupport No other TVs. Had already turned off Set top box and turned back on. Still no sound.  Have now unplugged for 5 minutes.
@VerizonSupport Everything was straightened out in the end, I had to maze my way through the website but the ONT replacement today fixed my issues!
@VerizonSupport I was trying to pay one of the devices off on my plan but no one is answering the phone.
@VerizonSupport EVERY show I try to play comes up with the error code 2054. It says update with newest version but thats on y'all.
@VerizonSupport Now i'm getting blank 3 second ads that turn my screen black 👍🏼👍🏼
@VerizonSupport All was settled using online chat.
@VerizonSupport I have a few issues. But I don’t think Verizon can help with them.
@VerizonSupport Why did they offer none when I called and was also passed to supervisor suggested I look for a free app
@VerizonSupport Mobile
@VerizonSupport Crickets
@VerizonSupport I just did and it's being escalated. I wonder how the ball can be dropped like this. Is there no review of new accounts?
@VerizonSupport Turns out you can't offer DSL service in my area! So I have been paying for a line that I never should have ordered. I expect a full refund!
@VerizonSupport I've spent the last 45 minutes in a store to add a cable card to my account &amp; 2 calls to the help desk by your Rep still can't figure it out
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport Starting to consider @116136
@VerizonSupport ok thanks. I’ll keep checking.
@VerizonSupport My mobile account, &amp; I have apparently  spoken to everyone with the authority or ability to help. I am extremely frustrated.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport No. I do not have a cable. This is a constant issue. I'd like to have Verizon install it properly. The ethernet ports were never activated
@VerizonSupport I meant the ports in the wall. I do not have an ethernet port in my devices.
@VerizonSupport No
@VerizonSupport They’re good
@VerizonSupport Stil doing it and on multiple receivers
@VerizonSupport I misread, thought you asked other channels. This is the only channel doing it across 2 receivers
@VerizonSupport Cell
@VerizonSupport So I can’t watch a show on demand without paying? I have to watch it on my computer?
@VerizonSupport A showed aired last night on abc and now I have to pay to watch it on demand. You’re answers make no sense. Please explain again
@VerizonSupport @115722 After nearly an hour in your online chat, I’m told that Monday is still the best you can do.  Hopefully I’ll get 2 days credit on my bill.
@VerizonSupport Yes I think
@VerizonSupport What did the bill team say
@VerizonSupport Ok
@VerizonSupport I'm sick n losing voice if u give me there number I can call
@VerizonSupport We keep getting this message for channels we pay for. Can you advise what this means? https://t.co/vGof3PHWlV
@VerizonSupport I power cycled yesterday, had everything unplugged for the length of a shower. 5g was fine for a bit, giving trouble again.
@VerizonSupport The same two at the top and they’re white, as usual.
@VerizonSupport Yep
@VerizonSupport Yep.
@VerizonSupport We’re entering the info on the router and the lights are white as usual.
@VerizonSupport I still have no service. Ticket NYEG0LVSVU. I was offered a prorated 2 day credit! It will cost more than that to replace the data used!
@VerizonSupport Yes, but I didn’t think they would result in that much of a difference..
@VerizonSupport Yes it is the first bill. I believe I was told my bill would be around $72.
@VerizonSupport No damage is done.
@VerizonSupport Residential. I tried calling Customer Support earlier, asked to get a call back via the automated system. Been hours with no return call.
@VerizonSupport In store...on the phone...online....
@VerizonSupport I paid the bill on Aug 25 after we cut back on services and a restoral fee was added to the next bill. Service was still on that morning.
@VerizonSupport And it can't be waived? Service was still on the morning I paid.
@VerizonSupport Nevermind. Awesome guy on phone totally helped us out. Thanks!
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport I need to speak to someone about my bill. I’ve been told only your customer financial services could help me
@VerizonSupport Did you read what I wrote? I already explained what’s going on
@VerizonSupport I’m calling this number 1 (800) 837-4966. I’m receiving a message saying I’m calling outside of hours and hat the hours are 7am-11pm
@VerizonSupport wired ethernet
@VerizonSupport unplugged.. far worse now... https://t.co/sykB7kFDW0
@VerizonSupport basement...
@VerizonSupport not much improvement at all... still around 18-20mb/s slower than expected https://t.co/VylRzxTHZM
@VerizonSupport ok.. late for me so I'll do that in the morning... thx
@VerizonSupport Wired connection, gigabit! thank you for the speedy reply
@VerizonSupport Site won't load via my home connection, and the latency spikes happen to any destination IP. Google, CNN, etc. My speed seems to be fine but the MS response is varying in the hundreds making gaming impossible
@VerizonSupport I couldn't get your link to load, but here's one from https://t.co/qKpeYIxIIV https://t.co/tLApVEAZzh
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/XZjUQmmebd
@VerizonSupport The gaming servers IP's are hidden to us to prevent cyber attacks. If you have a preferred site I can tracert to that as the latency is global instead of to any one server
@VerizonSupport Here is a tracert to https://t.co/xmaqJoOXhZ 
The first hop outside my internal Network to the Verizon server is 400 ms https://t.co/y0aoh5pqwI
@VerizonSupport You already have me. Tell Lowell I need FIOS. I’ve been on the phone w DSL tech support for an hour.
@VerizonSupport Nope. They have to send a tech. And a modem. And I’m not even on hold—he’s been working on it for an hour. FIOS, Lowell, FIOS!
@VerizonSupport The tech scheduled it for me. FIOS! FIOS! FIOS! Please!
@VerizonSupport Waiting for a manager to assess the situation and call me back. But it's been almost a month with this going on, very frustrating. :/
@VerizonSupport Wireless. Iphone 7 plus to be exact
@VerizonSupport Fios - Internet residential service
@VerizonSupport Done. Thanks for your reply!
@VerizonSupport Not that I know of
@VerizonSupport Site wasn’t doing anything.
@VerizonSupport Tried Chrome and Firefox
@VerizonSupport Yes. Did not work still. It’s ok going to stay with xfinity.
@VerizonSupport I sure can! Our original bills were okay and then jumped 100s of dollars due to an error. Now we’re expected to back pay everything!
@VerizonSupport We were billed but not for 100s of dollars but now they’re different. We’re more upset that we have to pay for a mistake on Verizon’s part
@VerizonSupport It’s actually the high speed internet service
@VerizonSupport Technically yes but that shouldn’t mean that we have to make up the difference since the error is on Verizon
@VerizonSupport That’s the problem though. We’ve spoken to multiple supervisors and have been told different things and that we’re to pay the difference
@VerizonSupport Yes they have. Each person we spoke to wouldn’t reverse the charges
@VerizonSupport No. I talked to two different people. Nobody helped.
@VerizonSupport Yes, they didn't help me.
@VerizonSupport He said someone would research and get back to me on Twitter.
@VerizonSupport The 1-800 number that redirects to our call center was disconnected on Friday – not sure why + we need to get it back up ASAP...
@VerizonSupport ...who can we contact? We haven't been able to get in touch with support in other ways.
@VerizonSupport Red for Internet and white for wireless
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport Yes, also quoted substantially more than what I pay now. It’s not that hard, I just want to move SAME services and my bill does NOT go up
@VerizonSupport I am seeing a video message that Univision wanted to charge us more, so they were dropped. But ch495 was never Univision. It was @47456
@VerizonSupport Yes, a couple of issues. I solved 1 while you were helping ppl out of order. I’ll remember this when they ask me to renew my contract soon
@VerizonSupport “Help is here” 😂🤣 good one! 
👎🏻
@VerizonSupport Yes it is!! Thanks for the quick reply!!
@VerizonSupport Waiting for an hour on the phone to order Verizon Fios. Do you guys not like making money. I waited on the phone for 3 mins with @116136
@VerizonSupport You lost my business. 1.5 hours on the phone and no rep. It’s a disgrace.Maybe you can build a call center with all those profits.
@VerizonSupport Let's do this.
@VerizonSupport Wireless
@VerizonSupport Fios
@VerizonSupport No, everything is green. Could it be a filter issue, or no?
@VerizonSupport DSL internet
@VerizonSupport No just the dsl.
@VerizonSupport Yes I do. I checked it and everything is connected.
@VerizonSupport Yes I have at&amp;t I purchased it through the NBA app.
@VerizonSupport .@VerizonSupport WTF. On HOLD yesterday 20+ minutes. Today 23+ minutes!!! NO Help. Are you F Insane???
@VerizonSupport I believe so. I was told to reach out to customer support to get it reapplied. It was keeping my bill at a good price for me.
@VerizonSupport Was even better when for free you guys nearly doubled my download speed and matched the upload speed
@VerizonSupport Sorry, I meant mobile
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Yes tell me why every bill showing different numbers 🤔 I don't understand, I supposed to be paying $50 why is my bill 90$ # internetOnly
@VerizonSupport Good morning, no
@VerizonSupport This is what I usually pay 🤔 https://t.co/ScdkQevBMs
@VerizonSupport My current bill ..which idk how $55 deal reach to 95 #Funny https://t.co/mSMbDUlBN7
@VerizonSupport Yes it was 70$
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/VZ0neY61BZ
@VerizonSupport Yeahh I'll have to call in the morning cause i never asked for that. I only requested Internet.
@VerizonSupport yes
@VerizonSupport didn't help
@VerizonSupport the globe is red, the bars are white
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/7mCk9mnIUU
@VerizonSupport i have a red globe thats solid and constant.  the wan light is not on.
@VerizonSupport yes i see it. what do i do to fully reset it? there 4 coax cables, some outlet plugged into the white box, and the black battery.
@VerizonSupport appreciate it.....never thought twitter would be faster and 100% more helpful than your phone CSRs... thanks
@VerizonSupport dont know how to do that, theres many wires and outlets.    who can i contact to get a live support.  ive been on hold for over an hour.
@VerizonSupport All I want is to activate my DVR box!
@VerizonSupport And to add insult to injury, somehow the server is ignoring it. All other boxes have full connectivity.  Internet is obviously working! https://t.co/4KyibgcJac
@VerizonSupport what happened to my points from the old program?
@VerizonSupport how many points do you need to watch a $3.99 movie?
@VerizonSupport It always says "eligible" to redeem points but never gives the option. Even went directly onto Verizon website. No luck
@VerizonSupport Whether I'm in my home state of Washington or Orlando Florida in work or using my data I have only seen 1-2 bars.
@VerizonSupport All services TV &amp; Internet
@VerizonSupport Yes!
@VerizonSupport Wow. Great customer service response time on Twitter. Great #CustomerService
@VerizonSupport for cellular~
@VerizonSupport @115990 I’m sorry lol got the account mixed up
@VerizonSupport Mobile account
@VerizonSupport @128838 Lies
@VerizonSupport Wireless.
@VerizonSupport Understood, but same device(s)used to run the test. (Tests ran on WiFi and direct connected). I’m standing next to the router.
@VerizonSupport And, before you ask, he definitely has more devices connected as I only have 2 (1 is using the connection, this one)
@VerizonSupport I’ll do it, but I’ve done this also. The speed test through the Verizon app? This didn’t work last time, and again we are both using ookla
@VerizonSupport Jay, I’ve been dealing with internet speeds for 25 yrs. I undstnd there r “variables”. There are also ctrl measures to show advertised speed
@VerizonSupport Can we do this tomorrow? It’s 11PM
@VerizonSupport I have these two things. https://t.co/BSYvFtk4EW
@VerizonSupport done. What should I be looking for?
@VerizonSupport negative. Nothing at all happens when I push that button. Should I disconnect and reconnect battery?
@VerizonSupport disconnected and reconnected. No change.
@VerizonSupport wireless
@VerizonSupport how can I directly connect? Do you know why I have such slow speed?
@VerizonSupport Ours is non profit organization (charitable trust)
@VerizonSupport This is a church
@VerizonSupport Yes. I have a question about buying the right router for my internet. New customer. I want to buy my own router.
@VerizonSupport ...to be the right one. I just wanted to know what specs to look for? But if u can't recommend then I'll look on my own.
@VerizonSupport Oh well when I opened my account the rep said I can rent a router but I didn't want to do that &amp; he said I can def buy my own but it has...
@VerizonSupport I will be getting all three (tv, internet, phone). Just want the best router for better quality ☺️
@VerizonSupport Wow I'm glad I asked. I used to think any router would do. Hmm so an ACS MOCA router? https://t.co/Zo29BpumfO
@VerizonSupport How is my Sunday weekend going for you ^BCW 😀
@VerizonSupport I'm ready now
@VerizonSupport It keeps telling me to call. I called an hour ago but said the offices were closed
@VerizonSupport Tells me to call for more info
@VerizonSupport The automated message told me to contact frontier. So does that mean you guys don't support my area
@VerizonSupport Can you check to be sure? Because it asked me for an account number and I entered my zip code. So I'm not even sure since I do don't have 1
@VerizonSupport I'm in Florida
@VerizonSupport Got an email saying there would be a scheduled repair in our area Friday into Saturday. Actually was Saturday into Sunday and still out!
@VerizonSupport My internet keeps going in and out. Ive had this problem for two days where I live but when I called this morning, no towers were down
@VerizonSupport Cell
@VerizonSupport I only watch maybe 5 channels and it costs a lot.
@VerizonSupport Cellular. The first was about being enrolled for a trial of caller ID. The second was about personalizing my name for Share Name ID.
@VerizonSupport Good question... let me check around. One sec 👍🏻
@VerizonSupport Love that you guys are on right now! 💯 Router was working great, then globe light went red. Restarting / unplugging doesn’t seem to help.
@VerizonSupport Found it! There is a red light on that says Replace Battery.
@VerizonSupport And....... I don’t think there is even a battery in here!
@VerizonSupport This one looks like it should; it’s just missing. Could that be why the router suddenly went down? https://t.co/ksfmP2VyUS
@VerizonSupport I didn’t know you guys were monitoring Twitter 24/7 to provide customer support. That’s great!
@VerizonSupport But I can only use the router listed? I can’t use my Apple AirPort Extreme?
@VerizonSupport Okay thanks for the info.
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport It just went up, but yes for about 30 mins
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport All of them are lit, and white.
@VerizonSupport Thank you.
@VerizonSupport Not to my knowledge.
@VerizonSupport Correct - nothing posted there.  But phone support says there is.  Getting conflicting answers
@VerizonSupport You just get this page with some console errors. I guess I'll keep using the stupid iOS app that sends unsolicited ads to my watch. Thanks. https://t.co/cQRZzxU9jx
@VerizonSupport That's not the point. Your support for Safari 11 is broken.
@VerizonSupport We had a deal worked out, they sent wrong boxes &amp; then told us there would be fees for little boxes after we were told there would not be.
@VerizonSupport No, my sister was annoyed because they changed the deal &amp; increasrd the price.
@VerizonSupport The installer took them back &amp; the order for service was cancelled.
@VerizonSupport It says temporarily unable to process your request. Please try again later
@VerizonSupport Thank you, it worked. Now lets work on dropped calls please
@VerizonSupport Everytime i walk into my apartment building in woodsude, ny
@VerizonSupport so the technician will provide the equipment needed?
@VerizonSupport Who can I talk to about this. I was on Fios support chat but the rep couldn’t help. I’m rather upset this is happened. Not really fair.
@VerizonSupport No other box. And where is the reset button on there? All I see are cables on that one.
@VerizonSupport There is no other box.
@VerizonSupport I've been dealing with you people for almost two weeks and getting nowhere.  I will call one more time on my lunch break.
@VerizonSupport I'm at work and will not give private info on Twitter.  I will speak to a supervisor again today
@VerizonSupport I am at WORK. I will call at lunch time. I will not give private info through email.
@VerizonSupport Can you resend the link?  Thanks
@VerizonSupport Ty
@VerizonSupport Yes
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/9TiQZKxv7B
@VerizonSupport That worked !! Thank you !
@VerizonSupport I canceled Starz on 9.25 but there’s a $15 charge for it on my current bill.
@VerizonSupport Done
@VerizonSupport No, my billing cycle runs 9.25-10.24
@VerizonSupport I’ll get it. Just takes time. Service is way better than the other guy.
@VerizonSupport i am. the second chat. i’ve water over an hour to fix this and no chat agents can fix it. I’m so done with fios.
@VerizonSupport Yes.
@VerizonSupport Was looking into getting fios
@VerizonSupport We've been trying to activate a phone that is locked and should not be. Everyone agreed no one can fix it. Back and forth no results.
@VerizonSupport Nevermind, It works!
@VerizonSupport Internet issues
@VerizonSupport The light on my router is orange
@VerizonSupport 7 times, yes
@VerizonSupport No but we did switch our Router, we bridged the FiOS router and a TP-Link router
@VerizonSupport On both routers the internet and the wifi light are orange
@VerizonSupport No the TP link is the main router and the Verizon Router is just bridged so we can watxh TV and have On Demand
@VerizonSupport I did, it doesn’t help
@VerizonSupport No I don’t think so.
@VerizonSupport No I plugged it back in
@VerizonSupport Okay
@VerizonSupport Well my mom is calling over the phone so she will ask them what to do is that okay?
@VerizonSupport @371888 Can you please improve cell service in Rumson, NJ 07760!?  I have at least two calls get dropped every day!
@VerizonSupport Residential.
@VerizonSupport no the speeds are fine but im just wondering if there are any tips you guys can give me on getting lower ping
@VerizonSupport ok, i did 2 test one on my phone and one on my pc my phone has a lot more up and down speed than my pc test, anyway to make them equal?
@VerizonSupport @119000 Red zone*
@VerizonSupport DEDQ0AY67R
@VerizonSupport That will be 8 days with no internet and only an "estimated" time. It was supposed to be fixed yesterday too. This is getting ridiculous.
@VerizonSupport Fingers crossed for no baby...
@VerizonSupport Also, the website is buggy on Google Chrome.  Works better on Safari.
@VerizonSupport This was for cellular and happened with the promotion deal you guys have going on
@VerizonSupport NH
@VerizonSupport Looks like cp-810 by sylvania https://t.co/IL3R7rJPc5
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/Hm1Wum39hJ
@VerizonSupport Ok
@VerizonSupport No custom changes.
@VerizonSupport It’s been reset 3x in the last week. All to no avail.  Same results.
@VerizonSupport We no longer have the device. How do I ensure that I’m not charged when the “trial period” ends??
@VerizonSupport Shouldn’t have to. We never stopped our fios account yet. We’re waiting to get set up completely but we never have yet
@VerizonSupport Weird my upload speed is 25mb but earlier it was like 500kb
@VerizonSupport How come my ping was 354 earlier
@VerizonSupport It was around 25mb
@VerizonSupport I did that....the picture on the TV never went away and it’s still there
@VerizonSupport How do I do that
@VerizonSupport They are working on it, I expect a call within 2 hours.
@VerizonSupport After recent move we had credit on old account, it was deducted from new account Received bill to our old address with same amount due. ???
@VerizonSupport Just being dramatic about not winning tix to see my @135926 ; despite having all four phones on my plan trying simultaneously for me ☹️
@VerizonSupport I have. I had to request I would like it. I was a Long Island FIOS cust and when moved to UES was upset you guys are not to my blding yet
@VerizonSupport I get redirected to a blank screen at https://t.co/n9lSurCgbB every time I try to click off the front page of the website.
@VerizonSupport I tried on multiple browsers. Chrome, Firefox, Safari.
@VerizonSupport Nope. Not working either.
@VerizonSupport I appreciate that! Your response is calming enough for me at the moment.
@VerizonSupport Cellular
@VerizonSupport I don't HAVE a gift card. I was told because I am not a Verizon wireless customer I can't have one. So basically I get NOTHING.
@VerizonSupport Bait and switch at its finest 😓
@VerizonSupport I believe I signed up in June and installation was in July. First I was told $250 GC after 30 days. Then after 30 I called and was told 90
@VerizonSupport There is no card. I called to ask when I was going to get it and everyone acts like I'm talking crazy "there was never a promo for that"
@VerizonSupport This one also the remote moves slower then the cable box im goin to Comcast https://t.co/VOr9VK6OwX
@VerizonSupport It's not the batteries its the remote its your service Fios is just horrible
@VerizonSupport For me, it is the rates, after being with @115725 for over 15 years.
@VerizonSupport @391600 Yes.  I assume over DM? Just spent 2 more hours w you guys and still nothing fixed btw
@VerizonSupport @391600 Putting these companies on Twitter BLAST works every time.
@VerizonSupport Just make a deal
@VerizonSupport Yes. and tech has been over multiple times, this time they sold me on a better plan but with contract, but this is even worse connectivity
@VerizonSupport I don't know.. I'll look.. I'm paying 160 a month for the worst cable selection and bad internet. This is criminal
@VerizonSupport All devices
@VerizonSupport And that is putting it simply and leaving out many many many details of your terrible customer service.
@VerizonSupport Perfect https://t.co/oXhOAnjreg
@VerizonSupport I don't have the service. Just doing some research.
@VerizonSupport A monthly service "allowance" to use the services that I'm already paying for?
@VerizonSupport Yup, up and downstairs. No football, no cops...nothin
@VerizonSupport Notice of suspension if don't pay. Verizon cables were down in neighborhood for 3 months! Huge inconvenience! Should have total bill comped!
@VerizonSupport I saw that lots of others had this problem too so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@VerizonSupport We’ve complained to you guys many times before about our WiFi and the best you came up with was “get an extended”
@VerizonSupport went from 4 bars to 1 and reception is poor. started after update last week
@VerizonSupport TV and Internet are down
@VerizonSupport Battery light is green https://t.co/xLDM6hfkm6
@VerizonSupport There is power, how do I reset that box?
@VerizonSupport It worked for a minute and then the TV and internet went back down
@VerizonSupport Yes, I tried resetting again it worked for a few moments then TV froze and router disconennected from Internet
@VerizonSupport Residential
@VerizonSupport Keep passing me back and forth.  The cancellation was supposed to happen yesterday.  I don’t have time for this nonsense
@VerizonSupport  https://t.co/0yx39H8np8
@VerizonSupport they say they aren't but they won't let us connect from our phone, desktop &amp; consoles
@VerizonSupport Will this stop my number appearing to others when they get called by telemarketers? That’s my issue at the moment - people think it’s me!
