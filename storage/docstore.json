I measured it with a volt meter. The lights on the ONT are blinking also. Its the BBU.\n@VerizonSupport Yes, TV, Phone, and Internet are all down.\n@VerizonSupport System Status Blinking and Battery Red.\n@VerizonSupport You are throttling my speeds from 150/150 to 40/40. Should probably not do that since it's illegal \ud83d\ude18\n@VerizonSupport Yes. 40/40. Hence how I got the speeds.\n@VerizonSupport Already did. Same result\n@VerizonSupport Yes. Now stop throttling.\n@VerizonSupport Hard wired.\n@VerizonSupport WOW! Now my speeds are even slower at 24/40. Thanks!\n@VerizonSupport How do I go about canceling service with @115725? Tired of doing this every month. @115900 is offering gig speeds for $10 more.\n@VerizonSupport What were you issuing in May 2013?\n@VerizonSupport Yes, so I\u2019m asking, should I\ufe0f have to switch providers to obtain up-to-date equipment?\n@VerizonSupport Apologies, but you still haven't answered as to when a customer can expect new equipment--5 years? When? #FIOS\n@VerizonSupport So, if I'm a customer for 10 years, you're not going to upgrade my equipment, ever? What qualifies as signing up for \"new service?\" #FIOS\n@VerizonSupport Does that mean ALL equipment, or cable boxes? Not replacing tech for customers who opt to stay with you seems wrong #FIOS\n@VerizonSupport What is the router you currently provide to new customers? Does it support 802.11ac?\n@VerizonSupport Yes, although we pay for faster (intermediate) wifi, the system can't support smart TV playback (amazon prime netflix, etc.)\n@VerizonSupport We\u2019ve been told they dug up something downtown. That and our little copper wire that needs an upgrade to fiber before we decamp to Cox.\n@VerizonSupport need a box because it wont fit in my tv setup at the moment.\n@VerizonSupport I guess it\u2019s still not working. I was told to wait from the cable team to contact me\n@VerizonSupport I\u2019m trying to figure out how my bill is 125.11 if I haven\u2019t had service since September 3.

The cable box turns off, when we turn it back on it doesn\u2019t resume playing the same music channel, it goes back to the previous channel that was being viewed.

Last time ended up hanging up. I dialed the Spanish line and NOPE, didn\u2019t get anything. Gave him our info and he had it and because I gave him several PIN numbers he didn\u2019t do it.\n@VerizonSupport Yes.\n@VerizonSupport A tech came today and fixed the issue. It only took 4 weeks for them to send someone \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f A month we paid for really bad svc and NO high def and even some of the regular stations didn\u2019t work.

Works on iPad and on my Fios box.\n@VerizonSupport Yes - at first it displayed a message that our area was experiencing an outage for that channel and it would be back at 2:04pm.  But hasnt worked all day\n@VerizonSupport No other channels are affected.  No message at all no on Red Zone - just a frozen image of previous channel.\n@VerizonSupport Still no go.  I do get the below now https://t.co/aCGh7wsQCJ\n@VerizonSupport Only Red Zone - same message on other boxes\n@VerizonSupport We're passed that now.  This is 3 weekends in a row now where you haven't fixed our issue.  Please look at reference # inc00487759.  If my redzone isn't turned on in the next hour we will be cancelling our service.\n@VerizonSupport Think so\n@VerizonSupport Thanks. You guys took care of it!\n@VerizonSupport My 3rd box in 2 months just went bad. This is ridiculous for the amount I pay each month.\n@VerizonSupport Because it was ridiculous. Twenty dollars savings. 289 down to 269. No thanks. You have no \"deals\" for long term loyal customers and I'll remember that. Adios.\n@VerizonSupport Hey, you had the deal to let me test streaming. I appreciate it.\n@VerizonSupport The page cannot be displayed because an internal server error has occurred.\n\nOver and over again. Only on bill pay. It's as if, it doesn't want us to pay our bill. Considering your company cannot even change bill due dates, at the very least the website should work.\n@VerizonSupport Yes. It\u2019s only the pay bill portion of the website. Garbage website.\n@VerizonSupport Nope.

It was even cheaper for me to end my contract early and pay the fee.\n@VerizonSupport The business hours phone agent said January 15th line restore instead of 7-10 days like the online and off-hours tech support we're telling me. Again, my neighbor on my floor has Verizon dsl. And it's working. My building is 5 minutes away from Verizon headquarters.\n@VerizonSupport Business team on the phone said Jan 15. I guess that's what you believe is \"assistance\". I have an entire building with half of the tenants having Verizon. I guess all 50-60 tenants in my building are on different lines.\n@VerizonSupport Wasn't useful the first time. Why don't you escalate this matter to a supervisor in business accounts. Have them reply here or email or phone (cell, of course). I don't need to sit through chat, explain again and have them tell me to call in to tell me Jan 15, again.\n@VerizonSupport Yes HR doesn\u2019t handle much they just refer us to speak to the head leaders over our supervisors and they just tell us we\u2019ll look into it\n@VerizonSupport Verizon Center, Etech Dallas, Tx Etech is a third party call center\n@VerizonSupport Who would I need to contact because if my voice will not be heard I will report to the EEOC and take further actions I\u2019m sorry but I can\u2019t\n@VerizonSupport I work for a third party call center though it seems that what\u2019s going on up there Verizon doesn\u2019t know anything that\u2019s going on.\n@VerizonSupport Tripple play with 1gig service Phone and whole home dvr. Now I called in cause I come from direct tv genie so I asked about dvr whole home\n@VerizonSupport Is there any other way? How could this have happened?\n@VerizonSupport Okay I'll do that, but how is it possible the 5ghz connection can work but not the 2.4? I haven't done anything to the router\n@VerizonSupport No, straight to the router\n@VerizonSupport I haven't reset it yet, but still no. I'll do it in the morning and get back to you\n@VerizonSupport Personal settings as in a custom router name and password? If so yes I do have that, but they were set months ago\n@VerizonSupport Yep. Network still shows up but I can't connect to it\n@VerizonSupport Yes, my 5ghz connection is working just fine but my laptop only connects to 2.4ghz.

The technician agreed that customer service was incorrect - hope this doesn't happen to anyone else. Thank you.\n@VerizonSupport I have been having issues with main cable box and internet for over a year. Customer service on the phone unhelpful - tries to sell me an upgraded box.
